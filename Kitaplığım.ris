AB  - Managing supply chain operations in a reliable manner is a significant concern for decision-makers in competitive industries. In this article, two mathematical models considering competition and integrity in a three-echelon supply chain under uncertainty are proposed. The competition is formulated as a Stackelberg game such that the distribution centers have more power than the retailers. In the first model, decisions are made about the location and number of distribution centers (DCs), allocation of retailers, and the selling price of products. In the second model, based on the real world, the probability of risk and failure for the distribution centers are considered. Backup facilities should be established for unreliable facilities to meet the demands of retailers during disruption. To capture uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic approach is applied to model the problems. The first stage of the model belongs to the strategic planning and is not affected by randomness, while the second stage deals with tactical decisions depending on the realization of the first stage's random vector. In order to solve the problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm has been applied to large-scale problems. Numerical experiments have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Next, a sensitivity analysis is performed to recognize the most important parameters and evaluate the accuracy of our approach. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the model, the proposed model was implemented on the data of Alborz Pharmaceutical Company. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research focuses on minimizing the life cycle cost of a fleet of aircraft. We consider two categories of repairable parts; upon failure of a first category part (No-Go part), its aircraft becomes non-operational but when a second category part (Go part) fails, the aircraft can still operate for a predetermined period of time before it becomes non-operational. In either case, to minimize aircraft downtime, the failed part has to be replaced with one from the good part inventory, returned from the repair facility or through exchange from a supplier-an emergency sourcing mechanism which is common in the airline industry. Motivated by the observation that a modern aircraft contains a significant fraction of Go parts (estimated at 50% of all repairable parts), we develop a strategic model to decide on stocking and sourcing policies using Erlang-A and Erlang-B queueing models. The suggested model provides an alternative to existing models that typically consider only failed parts that immediately cause a system to be non-operational, and do not consider an emergency sourcing mechanism. A realistic implementation of the model for a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, based on a list of 2,805 part types, demonstrates that significant cost savings may be achieved by explicitly modeling Go parts.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB  - Road freight transportation sustainability is gaining increasing importance due to an ever-increasing freight movement, globalisation and operational flexibility. The transport managers across the globe are finding it difficult to manage the increasing risks in its operation and implementation of risk-mitigation strategies under economical sustainability. However, very few literatures have examined the impact of sustainable risk management practices on road freight transportation. Our study addresses this important gap in the literature by proposing an integrated fuzzy failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) approach in the selection of risk-mitigation strategy on the trucking industry. Our findings direct to the managers that risk-mitigation strategies must be selected considering the criticality of risks along with the limited budget. In addition, we find that considering subjective evaluations of expert's judgment and cost benefit justification gives a convincing outcome while calculating of risk-mitigation number in FMEA approach. Proposed approach provides supportive guidelines to the manager to improve the decision-making process.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - Retailers and manufacturers are increasingly selling extended warranties to obtain high profitability. In addition to the traditional extended warranty (EWR), that offers a free repair and replacement service, a new extended warranty (EWT) comes to the market, under which an additional trade-in service is provided during the warranty coverage. The service provider faces three important decisions: (1) Whether to offer EWR or EWT? (2) How to set the optimal selling prices of EWR and EWT? (3) When choosing to sell EWT, how to determine the optimal trade-in price? To address such challenging issues, we first develop two theoretical models regarding EWR and EWT for a retailer, and further consider the cases where a manufacturer sells the extended warranties and the upgraded product has different failure probabilities. The results show that EWT should never be offered at a higher price than EWR, and when the handling cost for used products is relatively low, EWT will outperform EWR. While the optimal EWR and EWT selling prices increase with the product failure probability, the optimal trade-in price decreases with it. Interestingly, the optimal trade-in discount is not always increasing or decreasing with the failure probability. Moreover, an earlier trade-in time is usually better for the service provider. Compared with the retailer, the manufacturer will always set a lower warranty selling price, but neither of them will always offer a lower trade-in price or discount. We also find that the upgraded product's failure probability will affect the retailer's optimal warranty strategy and profit. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimal remanufacturing and acquisition decisions in warranty service considering part obsolescence
AU  - Shi, Zhenyang
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - When a product enters the end phase of its life cycle, certain parts become obsolete and their supply is discontinued permanently. However, the manufacturer must still maintain sufficient inventory to satisfy customer warranty claims in the future. We study the spare parts inventory control problem under such a setting, where remanufacturing parts from product returns is adopted as the main approach to ensure sufficient supply. One novel feature of our model is the interrelationships among the installed base, product returns, and demand for spare parts, which lead to the endogeneity of demand. Specifically, we formulate stochastic dynamic programs for two scenarios, in which a firm either utilizes phase-out returns or proactively collects products. For the former scenario, we establish the optimality of a modified-base stock policy, and find that the inventory control target increases with the installed base size and part failure rate. For the latter scenario, we discover that a return-dependent base stock policy is optimal and conduct comparative static analyses for the acquisition and remanufacturing decisions, where their one-sided limited sensitivities in state variables (initial parts inventory and installed base size) are identified in a stationary environment. These findings are largely attributed the novel model with endogenous spare parts demand. Through extensive numerical studies, we investigate the benefits introduced by acquiring returns under a range of parameter settings. It is found that when the mismatch between warranty demand and part supply is higher, firms can enjoy more significant cost savings. Finally, the potential monetary loss when the relationships among the installed base, demand, and product returns are ignored is examined computationally. The extra cost incurred is significant and becomes higher when proactive acquisition is adopted.

TI  - Does service recovery affect satisfaction and loyalty? An empirical study of medical device suppliers
AU  - Chao, Cheng-Min
AU  - Cheng, Bor-Wen
T2  - TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
AB  - Successful supply chain management can provide hospitals with new competitive advantages. Customer loyalty or repeat purchasing is critical to the survival and success of medical device suppliers. Previous studies have confirmed that trust and commitment are considered necessary components for maintaining a long-term service relationship. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the relative effects of distributive justice (DJ), procedural justice (PJ), and interactional justice (IJ) on satisfaction with service recovery and to examine the relationships between recovery satisfaction and three relationship outcome variables: trust, commitment, and loyalty. In addition, in the research model, service recovery justice was proposed as a formative second-order construct driven by DJ, PJ, and IJ. This study conducted a survey of medical centres, regional hospitals, and district hospitals in Taiwan and used structural equation modelling to show that recovery satisfaction was a significant positive predictor of trust and commitment and that commitment was a significant positive predictor of loyalty. The study also showed that the three dimensions of justice were crucial components of service recovery justice, which in turn had a strong positive effect on recovery satisfaction for medical device suppliers. The paper concludes with an examination of the theoretical and practical implications of our study.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB  - The escalation in product recalls in recent years is attributed to the rise of globalisation and associated challenges of offshoring. Extant SCM research suggests that product recalls have a significant negative impact on financial performance, but gaps exist relative to the managerial actions to minimise their impact. Recall response strategies have become more important in the press, given that a single recall may result in the mandatory withdrawal of millions of products from the market, with firms incurring enormous logistics costs and brand damage. In this study, we address this gap in the research, and using a measure of product recall defined as the volume of products withdrawn from the market due to product quality failure. We explore the scale of the recall in the context of pharmaceutical sector global sourcing strategies, exploring whether the variation in global sourcing decisions not only increases the likelihood of a recall, but also influences the capability to minimise the total cost of recall. Our results suggest that offshore outsourcing and captive offshoring have opposite effects in terms of their influence on the magnitude of product recall. We summarise the implications through a compelling set of insights for future global sourcing strategy research themes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB  - Volume ramp ups are notoriously difficult in digital services, where market pressures can lead to ramping up too soon and too rapidly which in turn can lead to the need to ramp down. This paper addresses the challenge of taking innovation to scale in an established firm by enhancing our understanding of the nature of service ramp ups and ramp downs. Digital service ramp ups differ substantially from production ramp ups as the speed is much greater, and problems are visible to customers. However there are similarities between service ramp downs and product recalls and an important contribution is exploring the nature of ramp downs their processes and possible causes. Using an engaged research approach, longitudinal data from three consecutive ramp ups in a European telecom operator were collected. Through analyses of cases, qualitative and quantitative case data, and using a system dynamics model, we identified a set of issues that affect service ramp ups and ramp downs. These include the need to ramp up the service supply chain, biases leading to unrealistic assumptions about scalability and problem-solving, decision biases in various functions, launching digital services in beta form, a lack of transparency of capacity and lack of learning from previous ramp ups. We show that if these problems are not addressed or resolution is delayed, this can lead to cycles of delay, backlogs and productivity problems and the inevitability of a ramp down. We explore reasons and importance for such delays that lead to service ramp downs.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of financial key performance indicators (KPIs) namely customer accounts receivable flow time and credit limit allowed by financial partners-on the financial sustainability of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) during business growth trajectories from an operations management perspective. This study explores the impact of a financing scheme on company performance during business growth, since new banking constraints for credit risk reduction have been introduced (such as BASEL III regulations). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a longitudinal empirical case study of a Swiss family-owned SME during a phase of intense growth, we have built a simulation model by combining agent based with system dynamics modelling that comprehensively represents the growing firm, its decision-making, and enables the impact evaluation of relevant financial KPIs on financial sustainability. Our analysis shows that the baseline scenario entails 80% risk of bankruptcy for high-growth SMEs; featuring 30 days customer accounts receivable flow time target and a credit limit allowed by the financial partner of 25% of last period turnover. However, if customer accounts receivable flow time is reduced to ten days, and credit limit increased to 65% of last turnover, the risk of bankruptcy drops to 30%. Our findings point to the detrimental unanticipated side effects of macro-level banking regulation on micro-level firm performance, and hence have implications for policy-making. Moreover, our study guides managers and financial service providers in anticipating risky situations, and in taking corrective actions by effectively managing financial KPIs.

TI  - Bridging technology adoption gaps in livestock sector in Ethiopia: A innovation system perspective
AU  - Kebebe, E.
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - The failure of the majority of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia to take advantage of agricultural technologies and economic opportunities in the livestock sector remains an unresolved puzzle. This paper assesses the role of economic, social, political and organizational processes on technology adoption in smallholder livestock production systems based on innovation systems perspective. Functions of the innovation systems framework was used to assess the missing links in the dairy sector value chains. The results show that weak or missing innovation systems functions such as entrepreneurship, knowledge diffusion, market development, and policy advocacy mirror the low uptake of improved technologies in the livestock sector. Shortage of domestic suppliers of key technological inputs and services, weak input and output markets and weak interaction among value chain actors have been the major hindrances to livestock development. For example, there were no reliable sources of improved breeds of dairy heifers, veterinary supplies, quality semen, and equipment. The results suggest that technical knowledge and availability of economic opportunities alone may not be enough to stimulate the uptake of technologies and commercialization of dairy production. The peculiar nature of inputs, services, and output in the livestock sector requires innovative business models that can facilitate the coordination of knowledge, skills, inputs, services and output markets in livestock value chains.

AB  - The container shipping industry is receiving growing attention in driving the performance of global supply chains. This phenomenon has accelerated supply chain integration (SCI) within the industry. Although SCI could offer numerous benefits, it is often quoted to be implemented easier in theory than in practice. The high failure rate that is associated with SCI is often not addressed in the literature. Grounded on resource-based view (RBV) theory, this paper is aimed at identifying the critical success factors (CSFs) and examining their influence on SCI and supply chain performance (SCP). Survey questionnaires were administered on 164 container shipping firms. The constructs were validated empirically using confirmatory factor analysis and were subsequently analysed using structural equation modelling. The proposed CSFs in this study are found to be positively corelated with SCI, which, in turn, is positively correlated with SCP. This paper has contributed to both theory and practice by applying RBV theory to identify the key resources and capabilities that are necessary for SCI in the container shipping industry.

T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Maintenance service plans (MSPs) are contracts for the provision of maintenance by a service provider to an equipment operator. These plans can have different payment structures and risk allocations, which induce various types of incentives for agents in the service chain. How do such structures affect service performance and service chain value? We provide an empirical answer to this question by using unique panel data covering the sales and service records of more than 700 diagnostic body scanners. We exploit the presence of a standard warranty period and employ a matching approach to isolate the incentive effects of MSPs from the confounding effects of endogenous contract selection. We find that moving the equipment operator from a basic, pay-per-service plan to a fixed-fee, full-protection plan not only reduces reliability but also increases equipment service costs. Furthermore, that increase is driven by both the operator and the service provider. Our results indicate that incentive effects arising from MSPs leads to losses in service chain value, and we provide the first evidence that a basic pay-per-service plan-under which risk of equipment failure is borne by the operator-can improve performance and reduce costs.

AU  - Adida, Elodie

T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - This work focuses on the business-to-business interaction between a service requester and a service provider in a healthcare environment. The requester is the primary caregiver responsible for managing the health of a population of patients. When a patient requires advanced care outside of the requester's expertise, the requester refers the patient to a provider and pays for the referral services. Treatment may succeed or fail, and in the case of failure, the requester incurs further follow-up costs. The requester may exert preventive effort to reduce the volume of referrals. The provider may exert nonreimbursable effort to reduce the chance of treatment failure. We analyze payment contracts between the two firms. We find that fee-for-service (FFS) induces neither system nor social optimum effort outcomes. However, a penalty contract can generally coordinate the effort decisions with either the system optimum or the social optimum. Furthermore, we find that patients may benefit from having a coordinating contract replace FFS. However, the types of procedures that make a coordinating contract most advantageous for the requester and provider are not necessarily the same as those that make the patients better off than under FFS. Yet, in most cases, the coordinating contract improves social welfare, as compared to FFS, and brings it close to the social optimum. Hence, the requester-provider coordinating contract can be considered as an improvement over FFS for the entire system.

T2  - OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - We consider an inventory installation, controlled by the periodic review base stock (S, T) policy and facing a fixed-rate deterministic demand which, if unsatisfied, is backordered. The supply process is unreliable, so supply deliveries may fail according to an independent Bernoulli process; we refer to such failures reflecting the supply service quality and being internal to the supply chain, as endogenous disruptions. We seek to jointly determine the two policy variables, so to minimize long-run average cost. While an approximate model for this problem was recently analyzed, we present an exact analysis, valid for two common accounting schemes for inventory cost evaluation: continuous and end-of-cycle costing. After developing a unified (and exact) average cost model for both costing schemes, the cost for each scheme is analyzed. In both cases, the optimal policy variables and cost prevail in closed-form, having an identical structure to those of EOQ (with backorders). In fact, under continuous costing, the optimal solution reduces to EOQ for perfect supply. Analytical properties, demonstrating the impact of deteriorating supply quality on the optimal policy, are established. Moreover, computations reveal the cost impact of deploying heuristics that either ignore supply disruptions or rely on inaccurate costing information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Several supply chain components are important to sustain point-of-care (POC) testing services in rural settings. To evaluate the availability of POC diagnostic tests in rural Ghana's primary healthcare (PHC) clinics, we conducted an audit of the supply chain management for POC diagnostic services in rural Upper East Region's (UER) PHC clinics, Ghana to determine the reasons/causes of POC tests deficiencies. Material and methods We conducted a review of accessible POC diagnostics in 100 PHC clinics in UER, Ghana from February to March 2018. We used a monitoring audit tool adopted from the World Health Organization and Management Science for Health guidelines for supply chain management of diagnostics for compliance. We determined a clinic's compliance with the stipulated guidelines, and a composite compliant score was defined as a percentage rating of 90 to 100%. We used univariate logistic regression analysis in Stata 14 to determine the level of association between supply chain management and the audit variables. Results Overall, the composite compliant score of supply chain management for existing POC tests was at 81% (95% CI: 79%-82%). The mean compliance with distribution guidelines was at 93.8% (95% CI: 91.9%-95.6%) the highest score, whilst inventory management scored the lowest, at 53.5% (95% CI: 49.5%-57.5%) compliance. Of the 13 districts in the region, the results showed complete stock-out of blood glucose test in all selected PHC clinics in seven (53.8%) districts, haemoglobin and hepatitis B virus test in three (23.1%), and urine protein test in two (15.4%) districts. Based on our univariate logistics regression models, stock-out of tests at the Regional Medical and District Health Directorates stores in the region, high clinic attendance, lack of documentation of expiry date/expired tests, poor documentation of inventory level, poor monitoring of monthly consumption level, and failure to document unexplained losses of the various POC tests were significant predictors of complete test stock-out in most of the clinics in the Upper East Region. Discussion There is poor supply chain management of POC diagnostic tests in UER's PHC clinics. Improvement in inventory management and human resource capacity for POC testing is critical to ensure accessibility and sustainability of POC diagnostic services in resource-limited settings PHC clinics.

T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Manufacturing relies on the Internet of things and intelligent internet technology to provide users with remote monitoring services and early warning of failure, to ensure the smooth operation of the equipment. Based on this background, this paper takes equipment user (customer) and maintenance service provider (agent) consist of the two-stage maintenance service supply chain as the research object. A model is proposed for the maintenance service contracts design, optimization under decentralized decision-making and centralized decision-making. The model is developed under the assumption that there is one customer and one unique service provider who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and is called the agent in this paper. Besides, an extensive sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the impact on the improvement factor of the model output. Under the selective maintenance service outsourcing strategy, the agent makes the price of incomplete preventive maintenance, and the customer decides the incomplete preventive maintenance cycle and the times according to the price. Confronting the equipment failure, customer self-repair service and commitments for the loss of equipment downtime, the customer decides the optimal maintenance services prices, and the agent decides the optimal numbers and the cycles of the preventive maintenance service (equipment life).

TI  - Development of supply chain risk management approaches for construction projects: A grounded theory approach
AU  - Shojaei, Payam

T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Construction projects face numerous risks during their lifecycle due to their inherent complexities and intricate relationships between different parties involved in the construction process. Accordingly, an effective management of risks throughout the project's supply chain is critical to avoid time and cost overruns, that if not controlled properly, will ultimately result in project failure. Despite the great significance of this issue, there is a gap between the literature and practice of project risk management, where managers mostly prefer to rely on their own experiences rather than using available analytical tools. On the other hand, the application of the best practices (such as supply chain management and supply chain risk management) from the manufacturing industry in the service industry is highly neglected. To this end, these two gaps are bridged by proposing a comprehensive supply chain risk management approach for construction projects that uses, grounded theory, fuzzy cognitive mapping, and grey relational analysis. A real world case study is presented to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Various risk mitigation scenarios are developed and evaluated by the proposed approach. These scenarios are ranked and the best risk mitigation scenarios are identified. By comparing the proposed approach with similar researches in the literature, it is shown that the proposed approach is capable of capturing and representing expert's perceptions of risks in an effective and time efficient manner. Moreover, decision-makers are enabled to simulate the long term effects of different risk mitigation strategies on the risks and make more informed decisions. Along with the novel approach proposed, the major contribution of this study is setting the stage for a discussion between project management field's scholars and practitioners with those in the manufacturing industry to benefit from an opportunity for mutual growth.

TI  - A Continuous Approximation Approach Based on Regular Hexagon Partition for the Facility Location Problem under Disruptions Risk
AU  - Wang, Jiguang
AU  - Wu, Yucai
T2  - COMPLEXITY
AB  - Today's business environment is complex, dynamic, and uncertain which makes a supply chain facility increasingly vulnerable to disruption from various risk accidents as one of the main threats to the whole supply chain's operation. However, in general, most of the studies on facility location problems assume that the facilities, once built, will always run availably and reliably. In fact, although the probability is very low, supply chain disruptions often incur disastrous consequences. Therefore, it is critical to account for disruptions during designing supply chain networks. To accomplish planned outcomes and greater supply chain resiliency, this article proposes a continuous approximation approach based on regular hexagon partition to address the reliable facility location problems with consideration of facility disruptions risk. The optimization goal is to determine the best facility location that minimizes the expected total system cost on the premise that the supply chain network is not disrupted as a whole when one or some facilities are subject to probabilistic failure. Our numerical experiment discusses the performance of the proposed solution approaches which demonstrates that the benefits of considering disruptions in the supply chain design can be significant. In addition, considering the impact of disruption probability estimation error on the optimal decision, the misestimating of the disruption probability is also investigated in this paper.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB  - The increased frequency of the adoption of service-based business models by manufacturers, such as solution provision, has given rise to service triads. While there is consensus that actors in service triads are relationally and performatively interdependent, less is understood about how service triads are controlled and coordinated. In this study, we use an inductive case-based approach to build an understanding about the roles, approaches, and contextual factors that influence how service triads are controlled and coordinated. We collected and analyzed data from nine companies forming three service triads, each comprising a customer, a manufacturer of an asset, and a service supplier. We synthesized our findings in a theoretical framework, where we show that first, both, control and coordination, are present in service triads rather than just control as previously posited. Second, controlling and coordinating service triads is not a single actor's responsibility but rather a collective effort shared by two or three actors. Third, we uncovered four contingent factors that influence the dynamics of how service triads are controlled and coordinated: the customer's risk exposure due to the offering's failure, the substitutability of the offering, the contractual safeguards, and the relationship closeness.

TI  - FOOD INTEGRITY THROUGHOUT THE CHAIN: THE CASE OF GOOD DISTRIBUTION PRACTICE
AU  - Renko, Sanda
AU  - Petljak, Kristina
AU  - Naletina, Dora
T2  - LOGFORUM
AB  - Background: The importance of supply chain management has increased, as consumer concerns about food safety and quality have become more important, along with the demands for large amounts of consistent and reliable products. During distribution, food is exposed to various risks, such as inadequate storage or failure to keep a certain temperature, which consequently affects food integrity. This paper explains the procedures distributors are implementing to guarantee food safety, food quality and overall food integrity in the supply chain. Methods: This paper involves a qualitative study approach. Face to face interviews were conducted in the four (4) leading logistics companies in the cold chain segment, which provide logistics solutions, from delivery of the goods from the manufacturing company to the point of sale. Results: In order to ensure that high quality products are transported properly, and risks are managed effectively, the companies operate in accordance with the principles of different standards. They have work procedures within each activity in the food supply chain to avoid the distortion of food quality and product safety. The whole process of food transport is followed by IT technology, and food categories are divided into nine groups according to the required prescribed temperature. As special requirements need to be respected during the handling of sensitive products, the investigated companies point out the importance of investing in their employees. Conclusions: Food integrity is a holistic concept that relates to food production and distribution, safety and quality. The food supply chain, which tends to be long, global and highly interconnected, leading to greater risk exposure, requires temperature monitoring at every link in the supply chain, particularly in the warehouse and transportation vehicles. Special emphasis on the role of IT and employees is given.

T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - Facility location represents an important supply chain problem aiming at minimizing facility establishment and transportation cost to meet customer demands. Many facility location problem (FLP) instances can be modelled as p-median problems (PMP) and uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problems. While, most solution approaches assume totally reliable deployed facilities, facilities often experience disruptions and their failure often leads to a notably higher cost. Therefore, determination of facility locations and fortification of a subset of them within a limited budget are crucial to supply chain organizations to provide cost effective services in presence of probable disruptions. We propose an evolutionary learning technique to near-optimally solve two research problems: Reliable p-Median Problem and Reliable Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem considering heterogeneous facility failure probabilities, one layer of backup and limited facility fortification budget. The technique is illustrated using a case study and its performance is evaluated via benchmark results. We also provide an analysis on the effects on facility location by prioritizing customer demands and adopting geographic distance calculation. The approach allows fast generation of cost-effective and complete solution using reasonable computing power. Moreover, the underlying technique is customizable offering a trade-off between solution quality and computation time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - This study develops a green production quantity model with random imperfect quality items, trade credit policy, service level constraints, and failure in reworking. In practice, not only the green production system but also the rework process is often imperfect. The presence of a single machine in the production system outcomes in limits for green production and partial backordering. It is assumed that the green production system may generate defective items, which are reworked. As a reworked process is also not perfect, it produces a random number of scrapped items. On the other hand, the supplier also offers a trade-credit policy to the buyer, which minimizes the on-hand stock and boosts sales. In fact, this model will help organizations to minimize their costs through cooperation in industry. The objective of this research is to find the optimal green production and backordered quantity of each item such that the projected total cost is minimized. The optimal solution for each scenario is derived and the application of the designed model is validated with two numerical examples. The results for both examples show that the minimum total cost for the green production system is achieved when the permissible delay-period given by the supplier to the buyer is greater than or equal to the aggregated sum of production uptime, reworking time, production downtime, and allowed shortage time. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed study is also done to illustrate the realistic usage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating the Economy for the Common Good stakeholders
AU  - Mora Rodriguez, Alejandro

AU  - Hilliard, Ivan
T2  - CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA
AB  - Objectives The Economy for the Common Good (ECG) proposes that the success of an organization be measured according to how it deals with its stakeholders: suppliers, financiers, workers, customers and the social environment. It does so by assigning a numerical weight to each one. The intention is that public administrations grant better conditions to those organizations that best behave with society as a whole. To be able to take advantage of these conditions, an ECG organization should produce a balance of the common good using the matrix of the common good, whose function is to allow organizations to measure in their contribution to the well-being of society. The objective of this article is to present three models that permits flexibility in the weight that is initially granted to each of the five stakeholders, and therefore contribute to an ongoing conversation within the ECG community. The models embody three ways to represent the weight of each stakeholder, by analyzing the type of relationship that organization has with each of its stakeholders. In the case of suppliers, the model goes a step further, by estimating the weight of each of the stages that make up the supply chain. Design, Methodology, Approach In the case of each of the models, a dynamic measurement process is proposed, based on the circumstances of each organization at the time their situation is evaluated, which can be updated in each of the evaluation reviews that are carried out. The first methodology is based on quantifying the relationship established with each stakeholder based what the relationship costs in money, by measuring what each stakeholder contributes to the relationship in market prices. The other two methodologies are based on quantifying the relationship based on time, in the case of the second model, the working hours dedicated to the relationship, and in the case of the third model, these working hours adjusted to the environmental behavior of the organization. Methodology 1: The magnitude of market prices To measure the relative importance of each stakeholder for an organization, the market price is used in this methodology. For conventional economics, price in an ideal perfect market, without market failures, shows the level of efficiency in achieving balance of what is offered by producers and what is demanded by consumers (organizations and families). Adding the price that the organization pays or obtains from each stakeholder provides a global contribution that, according to market prices, is relative to the contribution by its stakeholders. With the price of each stakeholder as a percentage of the total, it will be possible to know, by means of a rule of three, their relative weight over the whole. Methodology 2: The magnitude of hours of work Without the work of people (present or past in the development of machinery), there are no products and therefore there is no economic activity. The time dedicated to this work expresses the portion of life dedicated to the relationship, a magnitude that puts the life of each person at the center of that relationship. Each stakeholder has more or less relation with other agents depending on the time contributed to each relationship. Material and service suppliers-both direct and further down the supply chain-provide time to facilitate the means of production to other organizations. Financial suppliers provide the time required to assess a proposal and grant a loan, or open a deposit. Each of these suppliers contributes to the good sold by the EGC organization the time of their workers in several senses-the time necessary to transform the intermediate goods, plus the time incorporated in the intermediate goods contributed by the suppliers, plus the time that the financial intermediaries have dedicated to manage the financing. In summary, each of the hours dedicated represent contributions of time, contributions of life from / to the different stakeholders. The contribution in time are hours of life that the organization which performs the balance receives and gives to its stakeholders and can be measured in working hours. Methodology 3: The magnitude of hours of work adjusted to the impact produced in the environment The environment that surrounds the organization devotes time to the organization and the organization corresponds to the environment to a greater or lesser extent. Conventional, neoclassical economics considers the economy as an isolated subsystem, self-sufficient, and considers that part of its study is environmental economics, where manufacturing, human and natural capital are substitutable, and the only unit of measurement is the price, which also incorporates measuring and paying for environmental externalities. Against this vision, the ecological economy argues that the whole is not the economy but the biosphere, and that the economy is only a subsystem of the social. The economy is within a natural framework that supports and enables its operation, and therefore the unit of measurement has to go beyond the price and provide for the measurement of physical units, within a global framework. The previous section while studying the hours of work, implicitly recognizes the participation of the other, through the percentage of their life dedicated to the organization, thereby breaking with a self-sufficient individualism which has conveniently forgotten that people need the means to live. Therefore, the centrality of each person's life must take into account, and give due importance, to the nature that sustains that life. The magnitude of “environmentally adjusted hours of work” corrects the magnitude of “hours of work” by collecting the deviations from the world average of how the economic activity of each organization affects water, land-including energy and materials-and the quality of the air. Results, Research Limitations From a rather inflexible ECG matrix in version 4.1, the newer version (version 5.0) has offered an important improvement in flexibility. The three methodologies presented of the article add depth to how that flexibility should be implemented, providing detailed proposals as well as a fresh perspective and underlying foundation. However, it is not without its limitations. Principally, it is worth considering whether the effort in terms of necessary calculation compensates for the added flexibility it brings to the matrix. Some of the data is easily available, such as the financial transactions of the organization (necessary for the first methodology), while the environmental ratios required for methodology three are also accessible and of increasingly high quality. For the second methodology, what is required is for the ECG organization to work more closely with its suppliers to garnish the information of time inputs. A second possible shortcoming is that methodologies 2 and 3 suppose some estimations, which could distort the results. However, there is a strong argument for saying that, since in any case the first link of the supply chain can be correctly determined, the result will always be better than for a uniform matrix. Therefore, it is considered that the added flexibility provided by the different methodologies more than compensates for the efforts required both in the collection of information and in the performance of calculations. Implications, Practical Conclusions and Originality The three methodologies presented improve substantially the balance of the common good, allowing the use of different magnitudes and the consideration of different degrees of flexibility to assess the relative weight of different stakeholders. In addition, the underlying philosophy of these methodologies is relevant not only for the economy of the common good, but also for those whose objective is a more equitable and fair distribution of the wealth generated in current production processes.

AB  - In a context where distance, user fees, and health staff shortages constitute significant barriers to accessing facility-based family planning services, the use of community-based distributors (CBDs) as counseling and contraceptive providers has been tested in several resource-constrained environments to increase family planning uptake. In the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kinshasa, a massive CBD program (AcQual) has been implemented since 2014, with lackluster results measured in terms of the low volume of contraceptives provided. A process evaluation conducted in 2017 assessed the fidelity of implementation of the program compared with the original AcQual design and analyzed gaps in provider training and motivation, contraceptive supplies, and reporting and monitoring processes. Its objective was to identify both theory and implementation failures in order to propose midcourse corrections for the program. The mixed-method data collection focused on the CBDs as a pivotal component of the AcQual program with 700 active CBDs interviewed. In addition, 10 in-depth interviews were conducted with clinical personnel, local health program managers, and project partners to identify gaps in the AcQual implementation environment. Issues with CBDs' performance, knowledge retention, and commitment to program activities, as well as gaps in contraceptive supply chains and insufficient monitoring and super-vision processes, were the main implementation failures identified. Inappropriate method mix offered by the CBDs (condoms, pills, and CycleBeads only) and chronic overburdening of health care staff at the local level compounded these issues and explained the low volume of contraceptives provided through AcQual. Midcourse corrections included a more structured schedule of activities, stronger integration of CBDs with clinical providers and health zone managers, expansion of the mix of contraceptives offered to include subcutaneous injectables and emergency contraceptive pills, and clarifying reporting and monitoring responsibilities among all partners. Findings from this process evaluation contribute to the limited knowledge base regarding “unwelcome results” by examining all the intervention components and their relationships to highlight areas of potential failures, both in design and implementation, for similar CBD programs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Given the tendency of the world production and service organizations towards the development of a sustainable supply chain, the Lack of concern for sustainability risks threatens the future of organizations. In this paper, a comprehensive and credible framework is proposed for managing the sustainability risks of the supply chain for telecommunications companies, based on a new approach to sustainability. In fact, the risks on different echelons of the telecommunication supply chain were identified based on a five-dimensional approach to the sustainability as a strong well-known method. As a case study, some major Iranian internet service providers were studied and analyzed to this approach by using failure mode and effects analysis method. After identifying the root causes and potential consequences of each risk, a treatment was proposed based on the capacities of the industry. As a result, the most dangerous sustainability risks in the considered telecommunication companies are technical and institutional ones, which account for almost 66% of the critical risks. Also, suppliers with a 53% share of critical risks are the most threatening to sustain the supply chain in these companies. The proposed framework, which is not only used by managers and experts in the telecommunications industry, but can also it can be adjusted to any other industry by related managers to maintain the sustainability of the supply chain performance in the long term. Furthermore, it can serve as a platform for future research in this field for researchers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between uncertainty types in service dyads between servitized manufacturers and their customers. This is an important research area because servitized manufacturers face multi-source uncertainty and need to manage this uncertainty effectively to avoid business failure. A conceptual framework of four uncertainty types is investigated: environmental, technological, organisational, and relational uncertainty. We present insights from four empirical cases of service dyads collected via multiple sources of evidence including 54 semi-structured interviews, observations, and secondary data. The cases show seven interaction paths with direct knock-on effects between two uncertainty types and indirect knock-on effects between three or four uncertainty types. The findings suggest a causal chain from environmental, technological, organisational, to relational uncertainty. This research contributes to the servitization literature by (i) confirming the existence of uncertainty types, (ii) providing an in-depth characterisation of technological uncertainty, and (iii) showing the interaction paths between four uncertainty types in the form of a causal chain.

T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - A new requirement for the manufacturing companies in Industry 4.0 is to be flexible with respect to changes in demands, requiring them to react rapidly and efficiently on the production capacities. Together with the trend to use Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), this requirement induces a need for agile collaboration among supply chain partners, but also between different divisions or branches of the same company. In order to address this collaboration challenge, we propose a novel pragmatic approach for the process analysis, implementation and execution. This is achieved through sets of semantic annotations of business process models encoded into BPMN 2.0 extensions. Building blocks for such manufacturing processes are the individual available services, which are also semantically annotated according to the Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) principles and stored into a common marketplace. The optimization of such manufacturing processes combines pattern-based semantic composition of services with their non-functional aspects. This is achieved by means of Quality-of-Service (QoS)-based Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) solving, resulting in an automatic implementation of service-based manufacturing processes. The produced solution is mapped back to the BPMN 2.0 standard formalism by means of the introduced extension elements, fully detailing the enactable optimal process service plan produced. This approach allows enacting a process instance, using just-in-time service leasing, allocation of resources and dynamic replanning in the case of failures. This proposition provides the best compromise between external visibility, control and flexibility. In this way, it provides an optimal approach for business process models' implementation, with a full service-oriented taste, by implementing user-defined QoS metrics, just-in-time execution and basic dynamic repairing capabilities. This paper presents the described approach and the technical architecture and depicts one initial industrial application in the manufacturing domain of aluminum forging for bicycle hull body forming, where the advantages stemming from the main capabilities of this approach are sketched.

AB  - The most significant issues in businesses within the scope of manufacturing and services are the sustainability of production quality, setting quality standards and reducing the waste amount during the manufacturing process. From this point of view, the aim of this study is to provide a better quality level of supplying households' apparel needs while reducing the environmental, economic and social problems of the sustainable supply chain of the apparel sector and extending the lifecycle of apparel. The importance of risk analyses and calculations in the applications of industrial sectors plays a vital role in evaluating the factors of sustainability dimensions. In order to address this risk analysis in this research, quality-oriented implementations are applied to determine the failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA). The significant factors are determined via Pareto Analysis (PA) to control and prevent potential errors and failures in the manufacturing systems of the textile industry. To achieve the aim of this study, the methodology of the research focuses on discovering failures of negative impact based on the primary factor degrees with the computing of risk priority numbers (RPNs) in the manufacturing process of the textile-apparel industry in Turkey. According to the ranking of the RPM, FMEA application and PA enable to decrease the effects of negative factors and risks as well as the waste amount of the apparel-textile industry, as well as to increase the lifecycle of apparel and products.

T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
AB  - This paper considers the design of a multi-echelon supply chain network with unreliable facilities when the facilities can be “hardened” (their capacity increased and their probability of full or partial failures decreased) by more investment. The objective function of the problem is the minimization of the expected costs, including the fixed and the service costs, in all the echelons of the supply chain such that maintaining the flow of the demand at different echelons of the network interconnects them. In order to see how the decisions of each echelon affect other echelons, we consider a scenario in which facilities at the lower echelons of the chain are customers to the higher echelons and vice versa. A new scenario-based formulation is proposed for the problem to effectively cover the outcomes of this uncertainty. Moreover, we discuss how to use this model to choose the location and the hardening level of each facility to be both inexpensive and reliable. These decisions lead to some managerial insights. Given the computational complexity of the model, especially for the large-scale problems, several efficient approximation algorithms are presented. Finally, the computational results are provided to show the validity of the proposed model and the efficiency of the algorithms in providing high-quality solutions within acceptable times. The results show that the adoption of the integrated approach at different echelons of the network through the cooperation between the owners of echelons is much more effective than the independent optimization of each one.

AB  - Interdependencies among healthcare providers result in complex healthcare supply chains with fragmented healthcare processes characterized by coordination failure and incentive misalignment. In developing countries where resources are scarce such coordination failures can have a severe impact on patient health. However, limited knowledge exists about how coordination takes place across and within the different healthcare service providers and how this influences hospital transfer time and length of stay. This article research this gap by studying trauma care delivery in India using a patient survey (n = 104). The Indian healthcare system is insightful because India has to provide low-cost care to large populations living in geographically big areas and the healthcare infrastructure struggles to meet increasing demands. The findings suggest mechanisms to better integrate the processes from the accident site to the hospital which include setting up referral processes, 24-hour ambulance services, using third-party coordinators and process improvement within the hospital following lean principles.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study investigates one of the reverse logistics issues, after-sale repair service for in-warranty products. After-sale repair service is critical to customer service and customer satisfaction. Nonetheless, the uncertainty in the number of defective products returned makes forecasting and inventory planning of service parts difficult, which leads to a backlog of returned defectives or an increase in inventory costs. Based on Bathtub Curve (BTC) theory and Markov Decision Process (MDP), this study develops a dynamic product failure rate forecasting (PFRF) model to enable third-party repair service providers to effectively predict the demand for service parts and, thus, mitigate risk impacts of over- or under-stocking of service parts. A simulation experiment, based on the data collected from a 3C (computer, communication, and consumer electronics) firm, and a sensitivity analysis are conducted to validate the proposed model. The proposed model outperforms other approaches from previous studies. Considering the number of new products launched every year, the model could yield significant inventory cost savings. Managerial and research implications of our findings are presented, with suggestions for future research.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Greater use of multimodal transportation can substantially improve the environmental performance of freight transportation. Despite strenuous efforts by public policy-makers to alter the freight modal split, most companies still rely heavily on road transportation, and modal shifts to rail and water have remained modest at best. In this paper we argue that this is partly the result of a failure to take a holistic supply chain view of the modal shift process. Synchromodality provides a framework within which shippers can manage their supply chains more flexibly to increase the potential for shifting mode. On the basis of a literature review, we broaden the conventional focus of multimodal transportation to give it a supply chain dimension, and propose the concept of `Synchromodality from a Supply Chain Perspective' (SSCP). Using a case study we show that when the supply chain impacts are taken into account, it is possible to significantly increase the share of inter modal rail transportation within a corridor, without necessarily increasing total logistics cost or reducing the service level. In this way the environmental impact of freight activities can be significantly reduced. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in low- and middle-income countries, so provision of anesthesia services can be measured in relation to it. This study aimed to assess the type of anesthesia used for cesarean delivery, the level of training of anesthesia providers, and to document the availability of essential anesthetic drugs and equipment in provincial, district, and mission hospitals in Zimbabwe. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey of 8 provincial, 21 district, and 13 mission hospitals, anesthetic providers were interviewed on site using a structured questionnaire adapted from standard instruments developed by the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists and the World Health Organization. RESULTS: The anesthetic workforce for the hospitals in this survey constituted 22% who were medical officers and 77% nurse anesthetists (NAs); 55% of NAs were recognized independent anesthetic providers, while 26% were qualified as assistants to anesthetic providers and 19% had no formal training in anesthesia. The only specialist physician anesthetist was part time in a provincial hospital. Spinal anesthesia was the most commonly used method for cesarean delivery (81%) in the 3 months before interview, with 19% general anesthesia of which 4% was ketamine without airway intubation. The mean institutional cesarean delivery rate was 13.6% of live births, although 5 district hospitals were <5%. The estimated institutional maternal mortality ratio was 573 (provincial), 251 (district), and 211 (mission hospitals) per 100,000 live births. Basic monitoring equipment (oximeters, electrocardiograms, sphygmomanometers) was reported available in theatres. Several unsafe practices continue: general anesthesia without a secure airway, shortage of essential drugs for spinal anesthesia, inconsistent use of recovery area or use of table tilt or wedge, and insufficient blood supplies. Postoperative analgesia management was reported inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified areas where anesthetic provision and care could be improved. Provincial hospitals, where district/mission hospitals refer difficult cases, did not have the higher level anesthesia expertise required to manage these cases. More intensive mentorship and supervision from senior clinicians is essential to address the shortcomings identified in this survey, such as the implementation of evidence-based safe practices, supply chain failures, high maternal morbidity, and mortality. Training of medical officers and NAs should be strengthened in leadership, team work, and management of complications.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Inside supply chains' exercises, evaluating suitable suppliers in light of the sustainability criteria, including economic, environmental, and social, can assist organizations to move toward sustainable development by considering their risks. Evaluating and choosing the sustainable-supplier for manufacturing services with lowest risks among candidates in the sustainable-supply chain management (S-SCM) is a vital issue for logistics managers, particularly by considering different sustainable criteria via three dimensions of the sustainability for strategic decisions. This paper introduces a new failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) model based on multi-criteria decision-making by a group of supply chain-experts with interval-valued fuzzy (IVF) setting and asymmetric uncertainty information concurrently. In fact, the proposed model evaluates and ranks the suppliers according to their risks of economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Concepts of mean, variance, and skewness are introduced into the proposed FMEA model, and their mathematical relations are presented based on fuzzy possibilistic statistical concepts. Then, new definitions in the FMEA are presented for obtaining ideal solutions under uncertain conditions with possibilisic mean and possibilistic standard deviation, along with the possibilisic cube-root of skewness. Also, novel separation measures, max- and min-indices, and new fuzzy ranking index for risk scoring are presented to provide order of sustainable-supplier candidates under risky conditions. Finally, a real case study for manufacturing services is given and solved by the proposed FMEA model to demonstrate its capability in the S-SCM environment. The results of the proposed model illustrate that sustainable suppliers have been assessed and selected with the least amount of risks according to three dimensions of the sustainability.

AB  - Hydroclimatic drought conditions can affect the hydrological services offered by mountain river basins causing severe impacts on the population, becoming a challenge for water resource managers in Andean river basins. This study proposes an integrated methodological framework for assessing the risk of failure in water supply, incorporating probabilistic drought forecasts, which assists in making decisions regarding the satisfaction of consumptive, non-consumptive and environmental requirements under water scarcity conditions. Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the risk of failure in multiple stochastic scenarios, which incorporate probabilistic forecasts of drought events based on a Markov chains (MC) model using a recently developed drought index (DI). This methodology was tested in the Machangara river basin located in the south of Ecuador. Results were grouped in integrated satisfaction indexes of the system (DSIG). They demonstrated that the incorporation of probabilistic drought forecasts could better target the projections of simulation scenarios, with a view of obtaining realistic situations instead of optimistic projections that would lead to riskier decisions. Moreover, they contribute to more effective results in order to propose multiple alternatives for prevention and/or mitigation under drought conditions.

TI  - The factors of consumer confidence recovery after scandals in food supply chain safety
AU  - Wang, Shuhui
AU  - Alexander, Paul
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS
AB  - Purpose - Viewing consumer confidence as a set of static factors has informed previous research and underpinned strategies used in recovering from food safety quality failures, but this approach has not delivered reliable and quick recovery from large-scale food safety scandals. The purpose of this paper is to examine extant models and the factors they are composed of, and suggest an extended model that has a better potential for consumer confidence. The paper focuses on food products where supply chains are visible, and use these features to group the findings. Design/methodology/approach - In this study principal components and logit analyses are used to assess the role of 30 variables operating in a consumer confidence model constructed from several existing in the literature. This combined model considers emotional, cognitive, trust and sociodemographic factors. In total, 14 independent factors are identified. The authors examine the factors, and from these, the decision-making mechanisms before and after the Sanlu Infant Milk Formula (IMF) scandal of 2008. Findings - The authors find that the factors considered by consumers are different for different IMF supply chains, and different again before and after the scandal. The authors develop the argument for an extension to the existing models, incorporating a dynamic consumer confidence system. Research limitations/implications - The paper uses a single survey after the focus event to establish “before” and “after” decision-making factors. Since the IMF scandal is recent and of very high profile, this is likely valid even if it carries memory bias effects. The study is directly applicable to food safety scandals in a Chinese context. Deductive reasoning extends our assertions to a wider context. They are logically validated but have not been formally tested. Practical implications - Using this system as a framework a checklist for recovery from a similar food safety scandal is suggested. The authors also suggest more general use for use where supply chains features are visible to consumers. Originality/value - Models for food safety consumer confidence recovery have previously focused on identifying models and the static factors they consist of. These do represent a reflection of how this phenomenon operates, but using the principals of this model nevertheless does not result in good recovery from extreme food safety failures. This paper contributes by extending these models to one that can be applied for better recovery.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to explore the service recovery paradox (SRP) in business to business (B2B) relationships. Previously, this phenomenon has been identified in consumer-facing industries. The research advances the marketing literature by highlighting the ways in which the antecedents of the service recovery paradox differ between B2B and consumer markets. Design/methodology/approach - This research draws upon findings on the SRP in the consumer setting and service failure literature in business to consumer and B2B contexts. For the analysis, interview data were collected from 43 informants among clients and service providers in the aftermath of a service failure. Findings - The authors propose an exploratory model of the SRP for B2B relationships. In the B2B setting the propensity of eliciting the SRP depends on (1) the characteristics of the service failure, (2) the attributes of the service recovery and (3) the shared subjective perceptions among boundary spanners. Practical implications - Empowered operating-level employees, straightforward communication, immediate responses and action plans that ensure future conformance are the key factors to turn service failures into increased customer satisfaction. Originality/value - This study is the first to transfer the SRP from consumer marketing into the B2B domain. Moreover, it derives an exploratory model of the SRP, which can be refined by future research.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICE THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the doer effect of service failure (SF), good prior experience (GPE) and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions for multi-agents in tourism service supply chain (TSSC). It specifically focuses on internal and external failure and recovery. Design/methodology/approach The study employs a 2x2x3 between-subjects experimental design with 12 diverse scenarios. It aims to examine the main effects of GPE and the interaction effects of SF and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Findings The main findings show that consumers do not show favorable behavioral outcomes when they have GPE with an affiliated party. Results of the experiments demonstrate that for hotels, there is no interaction effect between failure and recovery regarding overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions; however, for travel agencies, an interaction effect has been found. This indicates that an internal failure (by travel agency) should be recovered internally to increase the behavioral outcomes for travel agency. However, if there is an external failure (by hotel) then the essential thing is providing a recovery. Originality/value Although the service literature covers failure and recovery in diverse contexts, these concepts are rarely studied from a multi-agent perspective in the service supply chain literature. In such a chain, a failure by a different party may remain unresolved, and this may create a positive effect on another party, if they provide recovery for the failure. This means that the doer of the failure and/or recovery (the party responsible from the failure and/or recovery) may have an impact on behavioral outcomes. However, previous literature has neglected to focus on the important issue of which entity/party performs the failure and/or recovery, and the effect on behavioral outcomes. By focusing on a principal-agent relationship in a TSSC, the study aims to address this research gap.

AB  - With the development of mass customization, the traditional garment production model needs to be optimized to have a more sustainable structure. To meet demand for flexibility, low-cost, and high-efficiency, an innovative resource sharing mechanism was proposed in this paper to form a new sustainable type of garment production. Different from the individual production in traditional models, the new mechanism involves resources being shared among various manufacturers. The tradeoff between positive and negative effects of the proposed mechanism is a key issue for sustainable production. In the present study, an overall sustainable index, integrating four production performance indicators, was defined on the basis of an Analytical Network Process to assess various production scenarios. According to the discrete-event simulation results of the different scenarios, we found that garment manufacturers could obtain comprehensive improvements in sustainable production by implementing the proposed resource sharing mechanism under the threshold of an increasing production failure rate.

AB  - Supply chain risk propagation is a cascading effect of risks on global supply chain networks. The paper attempts to measure the behaviour of risks following the assessment of supply chain risk propagation. Bayesian network theory is used to analyse the multi-echelon network faced with simultaneous disruptions. The ripple effect of node disruption is evaluated using metrics like fragility, service level, inventory cost and lost sales. Developed risk exposure and resilience indices support in assessing the vulnerability and adaptability of each node in the supply chain network. The research provides a holistic measurement approach for predicting the complex behaviour of risk propagation for improved supply chain risk management.

AU  - Alfoqahaa, Sam
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Palestine, and thus to contribute to the existing knowledge on the critical success factors (CSFs) of SMEs in the Palestinian context, especially in the West Bank. Design/methodology/approach The study is comprised a survey of a convenience sample of 370 SMEs operating in the West Bank, Palestine. It uses a multiple regression analysis to examine the effect of a set of CSFs, namely, reputation of the brand, excellence of customer services, reliable delivery and product innovation on the success of SMEs. Findings The results show that brand reputation, excellence of customer of services and reliable delivery strongly influence SME success, while innovation is weakly associated with SME success. These results imply that success is tied to customers and competition more than to production, structures or finance. That is, reputable brands, excellent customer service and reliable delivery are means to success according to the results of this research. Practical implications The study emphasizes the need for Palestinian SMEs to maintain and develop their brand reputation, institutionalize customer service and develop its logistical systems and practices. Generally, the study suggests that there are specific investment areas for SMEs that can contribute to achieving success. Specifically, excellence in customer service was found to be the factor most linked to the success of SMEs, followed by reliable delivery and then by brand reputation and innovation. Originality/value While plenty of research has been done on what contributes to the failure or success of SMEs, research on CSFs for SMEs is limited. The study combines four CSFs not previously used in combination to model the successful performance of SMEs in general and in the Palestinian context in particular. Only some specific factors are critical to the success of SMEs and should be the focal point of SMEs' efforts as long as they are consistent with their nature as small economic entities competing with big companies in small markets. Thus, instead of using general factors of SME success, the study explains how success becomes more possible through specifying areas for decision-making or activities for the entrepreneurs to undertake, keeping in mind that there is a mechanism by which these factors work together toward the success of the SME.

AB  - Purpose - Managing risks is becoming a highly focused activity in the health service sector. In particular, due to the complex nature of processes in the pharmaceutical industry, several risks have been associated to its supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze the risks occurring in the supply chains of the pharmaceutical industry and propose a decision model, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, for evaluating risks in pharmaceutical supply chains (PSCs). Design/methodology/approach - The proposed model was developed based on the Delphi method and AHP techniques. The Delphi method helped to select the relevant risks associated to PSCs. A total of 16 sub risks within four main risks were identified through an extensive review of the literature and by conducting a further investigation with experts from five pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh. AHP contributed to the analysis of the risks and determination of their priorities. Findings - The results of the study indicated that supply-related risks such as fluctuation in imports arrival, lack of information sharing, key supplier failure and non-availability of materials should be prioritized over operational, financial and demand-related risks. Originality/value - This work is one of the initial contributions in the literature that focused on identifying and evaluating PSC risks in the context of Bangladesh. This research work can assist practitioners and industrial managers in the pharmaceutical industry in taking proactive action to minimize its supply chain risks. To the end, the authors performed a sensitivity analysis test, which gives an understanding of the stability of ranking of risks.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB  - Supply chain networks need to respond efficiently to operation disruptions, as one of their aims is to guarantee the on time delivery of products. Hence, robustness has become one of the important issues to consider when designing supply networks. There are alternative ways to measure what robustness means in this context. In this paper, we propose a new metric based on the effect on service level of the collapse of active transportation links. Numerical experiments are carried out to understand how different design factors affect robustness. Robustness under a targeted attack is compared with robustness to random failures. Results show that flow complexity (i.e. the number of potential transportation links between supply network nodes) is the most influential factor affecting supply network and its robustness, as well as the service level that can be maintained after disruptions. Thus, diversification both in supply sources and transportation routes seems to be key to robustness.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF SECTORAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS: RUSSIA AND BRAZIL ON THE REGIONAL JET MARKET
AU  - Yevtodyeva, M. G.
T2  - MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AB  - The article investigates experience of the Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer and Russian aircraft companies UAC and Sukhoi Civil Aircraft (SCA) in development and sales of regional jets. Analysis of the Embraer's ERJ-145 and E-Jet projects and the SCA-UAC `Sukhoi Superjet' (SSJ-100) project is based on sectoral innovation approach which examines sectoral industrial development from the point of view of co-evolution of companies, technologies, demand dynamics and regulative norms and institutions as key elements of sectoral system of innovation (SSI). Revealing the most important features of evolution of the modern commercial aerospace sector such as high rate of innovation, R&D and subcontracting along the supply chain, development of new technologies, system-integration role of the leading global aircraft companies, outsourcing the production of major subsystems, liberalization of the regulative mechanisms and some others, the author demonstrates with the examples of the Brazilian and Russian cases how these changes were reflected in national sectoral systems of innovation of Brazil and Russia. The comparative research is based on such SSI parameters as efficiency of technological changes, accounting of changes in demand and in industry's regulatory mechanisms, development of connections with suppliers, efficiency of investments, andorganization of sales. The research concludes that failures in realization of the SSJ-100 project were due less to negative consequences of the anti-Russian sanctions on aviation industry, than to some features of sectoral systems of innovation including those related to project management and mechanisms of funding. In contrast to the Embraer - a company that has managed to implement a state-of-the-art design and manufacturing system, achieved better balance between military and civil aircraft programs, successfully adopted foreign experience in coinvestment, risk-sharing partnerships and clusters, thus proving to be an effective system integrator, - the UAC and SCA achieved comparatively smaller progress in the above areas. Together with features of SSI other reasons of it include some mistakes of theSSJ-100 business strategy such as delays in design and certification processes, some technological imperfections of the airliner and therefore insufficient quantity of fixed supply arrangements with large foreign airlines, problems with investments, purchases of the equipment, deliveries of components and in other spheres of international cooperation, deficiencies of the after-sales service.

TI  - Assistive technology pricing in Australia: is it efficient and equitable?
AU  - Summers, Michael P.
AU  - Verikios, George
T2  - AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW
AB  - Objective. To examine available systematically collected evidence regarding prices for assistive technology (AT; e.g. disability aids and equipment) in Australia with other comparable countries. Issues of appropriate AT pricing are coming to the fore as a consequence of efforts to move to consumer-centric purchasing decisions with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and also in the recent aged care reforms. Methods. We identified and present three sets of AT price comparisons. Two comparisons were based solely on the lowest prices advertised on the internet, and one comparison examined recommended retail prices. Variables essential to ensuring accurate comparisons, as well as significant supply-chain issues were also examined and considered in the analyses. Results. The first internet-only price comparison found that overall AT prices were 38% higher in Australia compared to other countries, but did not factor in shipping and other related costs that are essential to include given that most AT is imported. The second internet-only price comparison found that overall Australian prices were 24% lower when shipping and related costs were included. The recommended retail price comparisons found that Australian prices were between 14% and 27% lower. Prices for internet-only retailers (those with no bricks-and-mortar presence) are consistently lower for all products than those sold by retailers with actual shop-fronts. Further, there is no evidence of suppliers earning supranormal profits in Australia. Conclusions. The results indicate that AT prices in Australia are efficient and equitable, with no significant indicators of market failure which would require government intervention. Efforts to reduce prices through the excessive use of large-scale government procurement programs are likely to reduce diversity and innovation in AT and raise AT prices over time. Open markets and competition with centralised tracking of purchases and providers to minimise possible over-servicing/overcharging align well with the original intention of the NDIS, and are likely to yield the best outcomes for consumers at the lowest costs. What is known about the topic? Government-funded programs are used extensively to purchase AT because it is a primary enabler for people of all ages with disabilities. Perceptions of unreasonably high prices for AT in Australia are resulting in the widespread adoption of bulk purchasing and related strategies by governments. What does this paper add? Carefully undertaken systematic price comparisons between Australia and comparable Organization For Economic Cooperation and Development countries indicate that, on average, Australian prices are lower than elsewhere when delivery to Australia is taken into account. It was also found that prices at brick-and-mortar shops, with all the services they provide to ensure the appropriateness of the products provided to meet the consumers' needs and goals, are substantially higher than Internet purchases in which the consumer bears all the risks and responsibilities for outcomes. What are the implications? Overuse of government bulk purchasing and similar arrangements will lead to less diversity in the available AT products, related services and retail outlets, resulting in less choice for consumers and higher risks of poor outcomes through less focus on matching consumers with the `right' products for their needs and goals, and ultimately higher AT prices over time as competition is reduced to a few major suppliers.

TI  - Examining the antecedents of the technology acceptance model within e-procurement
AU  - Brandon-Jones, Alistair
AU  - Kauppi, Katri
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - Despite the widespread organisational adoption of e-procurement systems, we continue to witness disappointing performance outcomes from their implementation. This can be explained largely by the failure of many organisations to translate the initial adoption decision, made at an organisational level, into individual-level acceptance of e-procurement by an organisation's employees. The purpose of this paper is to examine the key antecedents of the technology acceptance model (TAM) for employees expected to use e-procurement systems in their day-to-day activities. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors apply and extend the TAM to examine the factors that influence the acceptance of e-procurement by individual employees. The authors' focus is on the potential role of user-perceived e-procurement quality dimensions as the antecedents to the TAM's cognitive mechanisms of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The structural equation model uses the survey data collected from 139 e-procurement users at a university in the Netherlands. Findings - The results confirm the core TAM relationships within an e-procurement context. Extending the TAM model to explore the antecedents, the authors find that the e-procurement quality dimensions of processing, usability, and professionalism impact the levels of individual employee e-procurement acceptance. Interestingly, the system-level dimensions (processing and usability) appear to play a greater role than the support dimensions (professionalism) in these cognitive mechanisms. Practical implications - The findings indicate that the need for e-procurement training and on-going support may be lessened by initial effective design covering system navigation and system usability and by ensuring that an e-procurement system has expedient information and product flows between the buyer and supplier. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore the TAM and, more critically, its antecedents within an e-procurement context. It is also the first to empirically validate this extended model. Finally, by shifting the focus from the more typical organisational-level adoption to an individual employee acceptance unit of analysis, the authors provide a better understanding of how organisations can gain the most from investments in e-procurement and other similar e-supply chain management technologies.

It also can guarantee service ability of urban distribution network, so as to promote the economic development. Using the method of fuzzy reliability, series system reliability, failure rate, relative failure rate and failure function, the paper aimed at defining the key factors, the measure model and the measurement method of the reliability of urban distribution network clearly. Then, with the simulated data, the analysis of measurement model process and the application method are presented. The method can clear the level of the reliability and the weaker aspect of the urban distribution network which can provide the basis for improving the whole reliability. The paper sets up the measure model for the reliability of two-layer urban distribution network and then verify the validity of the methods. Bayesian network analysis is used to examine the influence of each factor on the reliability of the system, and the importance of each influencing factor is calculated.

AB  - While biomass has been recognized as an important renewable energy source which has a range of positive impacts on the economy, environment, and society, the existence of feedstock seasonality and risk of service disruptions at collection facilities potentially compromises the efficiency and reliability of the energy supply system. In this paper, we consider reliable supply chain design for biomass collection against feedstock seasonality and time-varying disruption risks. We optimize facility location, inventory, biomass quantity, and shipment decisions in a multi-period planning horizon setting. A real-world case in Hubei, China is studied to offer managerial insights. Our computational results show that: (1) the disruption risk significantly affects both the optimal facility locations and the supply chain cost; (2) no matter how the failure probability changes, setting backup facilities can significantly decrease the total cost; and (3) the feedstock seasonality does not affect locations of the collection facilities, but it affects the allocations of collection facilities and brings higher inventory cost for the biomass supply chain.

AB  - The logistics sector faces substantial challenges in meeting customer demands for higher service quality, speed and flexibility under conditions of continued growth in world trade and worldwide transportation movements, increasing distances and vulnerabilities of the supply chain. Additional challenges relate to the economic and environmental sustainability of logistics operations. While a lot of attention was devoted in the past decades to the operational and technical aspects, the business development phase has been put aside, causing the market failure of several projects. The paper presents the SYNCHRO-modal supply chain eco-NET (SYNCHRO-NET) project, which will demonstrate the effectiveness of slow steaming combined with synchro-modality in reducing the cost and the emissions of international supply chains and improving reliability and sustainability through the optimization of the planning process. Differently from other similar projects, SYNCHRO-NET combines operational aspects with a business perspective and represents a stakeholder-driven approach aimed at developing a close-to-market solution over the timeframe of the project.

TI  - Barriers to supply chain integration in the maritime logistics industry
AU  - Yuen, Kum Fai

T2  - MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS
AB  - Supply chain integration (SCI) is a management philosophy that centres on intra- and inter- firm coordination and collaboration. The aim of this study is to identify and discuss the underlying barriers that inhibit SCI in the maritime logistics industry. A list of barriers was identified from literature and interviews. Subsequently, surveys on the barriers were administered on 172 container shipping firms. From exploratory factor analysis, the results suggest that the extensive barriers can be parsimoniously represented by five factors. The first factor relates to the lack of trust and commitment because of the display of scepticism and opportunistic behaviour. The second factor is related to resistance to change which is a result of complacency and individualism. The third factor corresponds to the incompatibility of operating and strategic goals, which is caused by inadequate supply chain leadership and poor partner selection. The fourth factor pertains to the lack of resources. This issue is pertinent to small firms and those operating in numerous parallel logistics chains. Finally, the last factor relates to measurement failure. The inability to accurately measure and assign cost to the activities that are necessary for the completion of a maritime logistics service prevents the equitable distribution of rewards, which is a critical success factor for SCI.

T2  - ℡EMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB  - Despite their fairly recent emergence, start-up companies now play an important role in the economic development of countries around the globe. These companies have fewer tangible assets and capital, and therefore, the efficient delivery of services and products is a key business priority for them. Customer relationship management (CRM) technologies, which are designed to facilitate customer engagement during the design, development and delivery of services and products may play a significant role in the success or failure of start-up companies. Developments in new communication technologies have transformed traditional CRM into electronic CRM (eCRM), mobile CRM (mCRM); and more recently, social CRM (SCRM). However, there remains very little understanding of the factors affecting SCRM adoption in start-up businesses. The relative newness of SCRM technologies, coupled with the swiftly evolving nature of start-up companies: which has made them difficult cases to study - has limited the amount of research undertaken in this area. This paper aims to close this gap by proposing a framework that depicts the factors affecting start-up companies' intention to adopt SCRM applications, and explores the relative importance of these factors. Inspired by an extended Technological, Organisational and Environmental (TOE) framework, this paper investigates effects of technological characteristics (TC), organisational characteristics (OC), environmental characteristics (EC) and managerial characteristics (MC) on start-up companies' intentions to adopt SCRM applications. The results outlined in this research indicate that the observability, compatibility and trialability of SCRM solutions positively affect SCRM adoption in start-up businesses. Moreover, the availability of internal financial resources has a similarly positive effect. When considering environmental characteristics, it was found that support from venture capitalists, crowd funding support, governmental support, business angels support and external pressure all positively affect the intention to adopt SCRM applications within start-up businesses.

Although there have been many efforts at reform there is evidence of unresolved dilemmas of human rights, environmental issues and ethical dilemmas in the operation of the global value chain. This paper focuses on the role and performance of Apple Inc in the global value chain in Asia. Apple is the most successful corporation on earth measured in financial terms and yet has failed to find a solution to recurrent employment and environmental problems occurring in plants manufacturing Apple components. This analysis informs the current theoretical debate on the development of the global value chain and the continuing institutional failure that leaves employees vulnerable and the environment neglected.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY
AB  - This research develops policies to minimize spare part purchases and repair costs for maintaining a fleet of mission-critical systems that operate from multiple forward (base) locations within a two-echelon repairable supply chain with a central depot. We take a tactical planning perspective to support periodic decisions for spare part purchases and repair sourcing, where the repair capabilities of the various locations are overlapping. We consider three policy classes: a central policy, where all repairs are sourced to a central depot; a local policy, whereby failures are repaired at forward locations; and a mixed policy, where a fraction of the parts is repaired at the bases and the remainder is repaired at the depot. Parts are classified based on their repair cost and lead time. For each part class, we suggest a solution that is based on threshold policies or on the use of a heuristic solution algorithm that extends the industry standard of marginal analysis to determine spare parts positioning by including repair fraction sourcing. A validation study shows that the suggested heuristic performs well compared to an exhaustive search (an average 0.2% difference in cost). An extensive numerical study demonstrates that the algorithm achieves costs which are lower by about 7-12% on average, compared to common, rule-based sourcing policies.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In recent years, increasing numbers of luxury groups have adopted sustainable practices in their supply chains (sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, servicing, waste and recycling). However, the report from Greenpeace International organization (2014) indicates that some luxury brands/companies did not actively conduct sustainable practices to produce items, which is likely attributed to the cost and risks caused by such practices outweighing the benefits. This, to some extent, is due to the failure of developing collaborative practices. Specifically, some luxury brands may fail to develop collaborative practices to create value that are able to benefit multiple stakeholders. Thus, in our study, we explore the value creation mechanism to create sustainable value that benefits not only brands' shareholders, but also other stakeholders, including producers, customers, other stakeholders in the society (e.g., marginalized people) and the environment. In addition, based on a case study from Stella McCartney and Kering and the literature on value creation, we develop a novel model for guiding sustainable value creation (i.e., value co-creation model), where the conceptual building blocks and specific practices are presented. Our contribution lies in extending the knowledge of the value co-creation model from co-creation with customers to co-creation with multiple stakeholders and elaborating systematically and empirically sustainable value co-creation mechanisms including the building blocks and specific practices. In addition, this study offers significant managerial insights for luxury brands/companies to effectively achieve sustainable value.

AB  - Transfusion of blood and blood components is a critical element for the delivery of healthcare services to patients. Tools to help improve the safety of the blood supply of a country include: i) Clinical Transfusion Guidelines to improve transfusion practices. ii) An Audit System to monitor adherence to the guidelines as well as the effects of adjustments to the guidelines. iii) A Haemovigilance Program, which monitors the entire blood supply chain, develops measures and solutions to problems that might threaten the safety of blood component recipients, and monitors the implementation of these corrective actions. Transfusion dependent patients are those who require frequent and long-term transfusion support to sustain life. Most of these patients have been diagnosed with one of the following conditions: Thalassemia syndromes Sickle cell anaemia Chronic hemolytic anaemias Bone marrow failure syndrome, aplastic anaemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. In additions to the potential complications of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion common to all recipients, there are special problems that are unique in transfusion dependent patients who are on chronic transfusion support. The most common of these complications are alloimmunization and iron overload. Specific measures must be considered to decrease the burden of these complications on patients' outcomes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
AB  - In longwall mining, hard roofs located immediately above the coal seam should not cave and cause ground control problems around the working longwall face. In this paper, comprehensive field observations and numerical simulations were used to investigate the chain pillar and adjoining gateroad failure during a longwall top coal caving (LTCC) face retreat at the Majialiang coalmine located in Shanxi, China. The results show that hard roof strata did not cave behind the longwall face but overhung to form a cantilever beam above the chain pillar. The roof beam concentrated high stress in the chain pillar and caused the pillar failure. The concentrated stress moved close to the headgate and the solid side of the next panel, causing gateroad damage and rib collapse. Numerical simulations found that hard roof treatment could fill the space near the goaf edge and deliver support pressure to the roof as well as alleviate the stress concentration in the pillar and the solid side of the next longwall panel. Simulations suggested that a pillar size of 50 m or larger was feasible without consideration of hard roof treatment. A 40-m chain pillar with hard roof treatment could also satisfy the demand on the pillar and supply gateroad safety during the service period. Field practices verified the numerical results and suggested that hard roof treatment by hydraulic fracturing is a feasible method for overcoming ground control problems in a situation such as that presented in this paper.

AB  - The low productivity of many tropical pasturelands is a major driver of deforestation and other negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. In Brazil, the second biggest meat producer in the world, 85% of cattle farms remain within extensive pasture systems, and cattle farming is by far the most important proximate driver of deforestation. It is possible to expand Brazilian agriculture with zero deforestation through improvements to rangeland productivity yet understanding of the challenges and motivations of the actual cattle farmers in the face of such a transition remains sparse. To better understand the importance of the underlying factors that lead to or inhibit improvements to land management, we used focus groups and semi-structured interviews (N =250) with farmers from the state of Mato Grosso in the Brazilian Amazon. We found that the majority of the respondents (60%) claimed that the principal benefit of adopting good agricultural practices was increased productivity, followed by increased income (43%) and better farm administrative management (34%). The adoption of improved pasture management techniques was positively correlated with stocking rates (p < 0.005, r=0.48). Farms that adopted improved pasture management, most often through rotational grazing had, on average, lower levels of forest cover (p < 0.05, r =0.22). We found that scarcity of labour was the major issue affecting the adoption of improved techniques (36%), followed by financial constraints (18%). We also identified a shortfall in access to technical extension services to be a significant problem because 40% of the technical assistance is currently provided by vendors of fertilizers and other chemicals. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the barriers to and the conditions surrounding the adoption of good agricultural practices in Brazilian pasturelands from the perspective of the farmers from the Amazon involved in the implementation of these practices. It is critical that decision-makers involved in the design of technical assistance schemes, education and credit programmes consider these factors if sustainable land management is to be realised at scale. In particular, the lack of skilled and available labour contrasts with the widespread assumption that new credit lines for sustainable agriculture will automatically result in better land, management. A failure to consider factors discussed in this paper may contribute to the continued clearance of native vegetation and the environmental degradation of existing pasturelands, in addition to the persistence of widespread poverty among cattle farmers. These results can assist the large scale implementation of sustainable land use policies in Brazil and elsewhere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Climate change vulnerability in the food, energy, and water nexus: concerns for agricultural production in Arizona and its urban export supply
AU  - Berardy, Andrew
AU  - Chester, Mikhail V.
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Interdependent systems providing water and energy services are necessary for agriculture. Climate change and increased resource demands are expected to cause frequent and severe strains on these systems. Arizona is especially vulnerable to such strains due to its hot and arid climate. However, its climate enables year-round agricultural production, allowing Arizona to supply most of the country's winter lettuce and vegetables. In addition to Phoenix and Tucson, cities including El Paso, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Diego rely on Arizona for several types of agricultural products such as animal feed and livestock, meaning that disruptions to Arizona's agriculture also disrupt food supply chains to at least six major cities. Arizona's predominately irrigated agriculture relies on water imported through an energy intensive process from water-stressed regions. Most irrigation in Arizona is electricity powered, so failures in energy or water systems can cascade to the food system, creating a food-energy-water (FEW) nexus of vulnerability. We construct a dynamic simulation model of the FEW nexus in Arizona to assess the potential impacts of increasing temperatures and disruptions to energy and water supplies on crop irrigation requirements, on-farm energy use, and yield. We use this model to identify critical points of intersection between energy, water, and agricultural systems and quantify expected increases in resource use and yield loss. Our model is based on threshold temperatures of crops, USDA and US Geological Survey data, Arizona crop budgets, and region-specific literature. We predict that temperature increase above the baseline could decrease yields by up to 12.2% per 1 degrees C for major Arizona crops and require increased irrigation of about 2.6% per 1 degrees C. Response to drought varies widely based on crop and phenophase, so we estimate irrigation interruption effects through scenario analysis. We provide an overview of potential adaptation measures farmers can take, and barriers to implementation.

AB  - For certain goods or services, the quality of the product can be assessed by customers only after consumption. We determine the optimal time paths for pricing, advertising and quality for a profit maximizing firm facing demand that is influenced both by this experience quality as well as by advertising. In particular, there may exist two optimal trajectories separated by an indifference threshold in which the firm has the same utility of converging to either of the two long-run steady states. Or, to put it in a nutshell: the optimal mix of marketing instruments may lead to history-dependence. One implication is that there may be a market failure such that a government subsidy could help reach the steady state that is best for the Economy in the sense of having greater sales and a higher quality product.

TI  - The influence of organizational culture on healthcare supply chain resilience: moderating role of technology orientation
AU  - Mandal, Santanu
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to explore the influence of dimensions of organizational culture, namely, development culture, group culture, rational culture and hierarchical culture, on healthcare supply chain resilience (HCRES). Further, the study explored the moderating role of technology orientation on organizational culture dimensions and healthcare resilience linkages. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted a multi-unit study of different hospital supply chains (SCs). Consequently, perceptual data were gathered from seven dominant entities in a typical medical/hospital SC: hospitals, hotels, chemistry and pharmaceutical, marketing/public relations/promotion, medical equipment manufacturers and surgical suppliers, food and beverage providers (i.e. restaurants) and insurance providers. The responses were gathered using online survey and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - Based on 276 completed responses, positive influences were found for development, group and rational cultures on HCRES. As expected, a negative influence of hierarchical culture was found on HCRES. Further, technological orientation was found to enhance the positive effects of development, group and rational cultures on HCRES. However, no prominent moderation was noted for hierarchical culture's influence on HCRES. The findings suggested managers to focus more on developing competing values framework (CVF)-based dimensions of organizational culture dimensions for effective risk mitigation so as to provide healthcare services in a timely manner to patients. Originality/value - The study is the first to investigate the effects of organizational culture's dimensions on resilience. The study has empirically established the association between CVF view and dynamic capabilities. The study underlined the importance of resilience in healthcare SCs. Resilience is an important dynamic capability in healthcare SCs to provide uninterrupted treatments and services to patients. Any failure in such a service can be fatal. Further, the study developed the measures of development, group, rational and hierarchical culture for further investigation in healthcare. This study is also the first to develop a measure for resilience in the healthcare sector.

AB  - In regional commodity distribution systems, formed on the basis of transport and logistics clusters, business entities that are often united by the administrative decision of local authorities are in fact organizationally fragmented and therefore do not operate stably at a high risk of failure of the mission to service the transit material flow. Therefore, it is considered to be of vital importance to look at the scientific research problem of uncertainty and risk in complex conditions of the influence of factors of external and internal environment affecting stable and steady operation of the transport and logistics clusters, their identification, classification, evaluation of their impact on the cluster and the commodity distribution system of the region in general and development of activities aimed at reducing negative consequences of risk events. Using scientific methods of logic and system analysis, it has been found out that the risks of functioning of the transport and logistics cluster of the transit region are a complex economic phenomenon defined by the characteristics and peculiarities of the transit material flows going through the region. The authors' definition of the risk has been given, the risks of functioning of the transport and logistics cluster of the transit region have been identified and classified, allowing identifying the origin of their nature, to explore the economic substance, and identifying possible negative consequences, which allows us to develop appropriate measures for their leveling. The synergistic nature of the influence of the risk groups on functioning of the transport and logistics cluster of the transit region has been revealed. The algorithm of the risk impact on the execution of logistics processes in the supply chain has been defined and the consequences of this influence which are in a causal relationship with the environmental factors have been defined. The scheme of risk management for the conditions of the transport and logistics cluster of the transit region has been developed according to their hierarchical structure. The most important trends have been defined and the activities have been worked out to reduce the risk of functioning of the transport and logistics cluster of the transit region. Using the method of sensitivity analysis, which encompasses a study of changes of the value of the analyzed indicator by changing the values of its constituent parameters in a given range, the risks for the logistics center of Voronezh Logistics company located on highway M-4 have been calculated, proving the theory of the structure and impact of risks on the activities of the transport and logistics cluster.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES
AB  - This paper applies research in dependency modelling to a process-based risk assessment methodology suitable for critical infrastructures. The proposed methodology dynamically assesses the evolution of cascading failures over time between assets involved in a business process of an infrastructure. This approach can be applied by a CI operator/owner to explore how a failure in a single component (asset) affects the other assets and relevant business processes. It could also be applied in an analysis that includes multiple CI operators in the same supply chain to explore the dependencies between their assets and explore how these affect the provision of key societal services. The paper presents a proof-of-concept tool, based on business-process risk assessment and graph modelling, and a realistic case example of a rail scheduling process. The approach allows risk assessors and decision makers to analyse and identify critical dependency chains and it can reveal underestimated risks due to dependencies.

TI  - Perspectives and mechanisms of “circular” economy global development
AU  - Mishenin, Ye. V.

T2  - MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB  - The aim of the article. The article examines the conceptual, essential and organizational basis of “circular” economy as a tool of “greening” the economy and achieving the sustainable development. Results. “Circular” economy is seen as a sphere and a form of nature-social development, in which the reproduction of resources, information and energy, forming and developing of mechanisms and tools of their repeated (cyclic) involvement in the system of economic relations are provided on the innovative basis. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is a flow-process understanding of the nature of reproduction processes in the socio-economic system, and consequently, of the turnover of resources and energy within this system. It is emphasized that the concept of “circular” economy is focused not only on resource use, and to a greater extent on resources forming, resources creation, thus laying the methodological basis for resources management, consistent with the objectives and tasks of the “green” economy and sustainable development. The authors examine the implementation of the “circular economy” not only as a set of organizational and economic measures within the existing structure of the region and the country's economy, but rather as an orientation to the restructuring of industrial relations (economic, organizational, socio-economic, ecological-economic) and productive forces. In the context of the political determination of the need to build economic relations on the basis of “circularity” of resources in Europe and Asia, there are explored the mechanisms of the “closing” of material resource cycles at different levels of economic systems: economic units; municipalities and regions; national and global. It is concluded that the implementation of “circular” economy at the national level will result in the transformation of modern constitution, the structure and nature of the global material chains: the suspension of their expansion as a result of forming the “closed” national economies (self-sufficient in the resource provision) or forming the global recycling chains. The analysis of China's foreign economic activity shows that the republic, which is focusing on the implementation of the “circular” economy from 2002, shows the certain self-sufficiency in the resources provision to support own domestic consumption as well as to produce export flows currently. It is emphasized that, against the background of the implementation of the “circular” economy, the tendency to halt global production processes of fragmentation on a geographical basis is more and more clear, reflecting the formation of closed national economies. Conclusions and further research. On this background there were formulated the problematic strategic issues of further development of Ukraine's economy in terms of the global development of “ circular economy”: the high risk of further price fluctuations in key domestic export-oriented sectors, i. e. agriculture and metallurgy, requires the revision of the export policy, as well as reformation of industries with the focus on import substitution and on formation of domestic “ full” production cycle; the high risk of further development of the market of imported re-use goods in Ukraine against the background of the failure to form a proper waste treatment infrastructure threatens significant worsening of socio-ecological-economic situation in Ukraine in the short term.

T2  - CUKUROVA MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose: Appropriate management of medicines at the different stages of supply chain is important. Failure to do so will result in stock-out, wastage of medicines and financial loss which in turn affects the health care services. The aim of this study was to assess the inventory management performance of key essential medicines. Material and Methods: Health facility based descriptive cross- sectional study using both quantitative and qualitative method was employed on 20 public health facilities. Data was gathered using checklists, structured and sem-structured questionnaires from March 29 to April 29, 2016. Result: The inventory management performance of key essential medicines in-terms of measuring indicators revealed that out of 400 bin-cards selected 162(40.50%) of them were not updated. Only 28.50% of bin-cards were accurately filled. The mean stock out rate of key essential medicines was around 27.25% with average stock out duration of 35.31 days. On average around 10.43% of medicines were wasted resulting in loss of 174,366.98 Ethiopian birr (ETB) of which the value of medroxy progestrone accounted around 65.74% of the loss. Concerning storage condition only 5(25%) of the health facility have full filled good storage condition criteria. Budget constraints, human resource inadequacy, & over supply of near expiry date medicines were identified as major in inventory management challenges. Conclusion: The inventory management practice of the study facilities was found to be weak which was confirmed by poor bin-card updating practice, storage condition below the standard and poor stock record accuracy. There were also high stock out rates, and medicines wastage with loss of money.

AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to investigate the role that halal certification organisations (HCOs) play in the UK in assuring quality in halal cosmetics. Design/methodology/approach - The study evaluates whether halal certification assures the quality of halal cosmetic products. This research evaluated the quality assurance systems of major UK HCOs, using a hypothetical product as a test vehicle. The investigation considered whether these organisations differ in their definition of “halal” and “halal cosmetics” and also considered how effectively their certification signals quality assurance. Findings - The study indicated that there is a failure to adopt holistic halal terminology which implies that within the UK halal cosmetics industry, manufacturers may not be working within agreed standards for halal product integrity. Research limitations/implications - This study focussed on UK certification for halal cosmetics by three HCOs and disregarded other forms of halal businesses. The literature review is based solely on literature available in the English language. The study lacks generalisability, as only one hypothetical product was tested; therefore, it was not possible to reach an understanding of all the costs involved in UK HCO certification. Practical implications - This study undertook a comprehensive literature review on halal certification to produce a comparison of halal sanctioning laws, certification processes and the level of supply chain verification by UK HCOs. Originality/value - This study adds value to the knowledge on UK halal certification.

T2  - Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management
AB  - Value creation is central to major business-to-business relationships, yet despite the criticality, stakeholder value expectations may not be met. This study explores how senior buyer and seller-side relationship managers (N=25), managing relationships worth 5M- pound 750M pound per annum, perceive and manage value and the implications of these perceptions to both parties. In a novel combination, focus groups were used to generate the initial dataset and category structure of a grounded theory study. Categories were subsequently explored through 1:1 interviews. The concept of Internal Value Perception Dissonance (IVPD) is developed, and its properties, dimensions and consequences are discussed. IVPD adds a new intra-organisational dimension to the causes of relational failure. Value-dissonance theory is developed that directs practitioners toward pluralistic, internal collaboration as a precursor to inter organisational collaboration. The disparity in buyer-side value perceptions, shows that these organisations cannot be regarded as cohesive, unitary entities. The buyer does not exist in these cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A mathematical model is developed for integrated flow planning in forward and after-sales supply chains of a company supplying repairable product-warranty packages to markets. Ignoring their interactions, these two supply chains are usually planned separately in literature. We consider demand- and supply-side variations in pre- and after-sales demands and qualified outflow of the SCs' facilities. We show that to neutralize the impact of variations, orders should be amplified by moving from the downstream to the upstream of chains. Results of an example from the gear industry show what interdependencies exist between the company's retail price, service levels, and warranty strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The Green Deal (GD) was launched in 2013 by the UK Government as a market-led scheme to encourage uptake of energy efficiency measures in the UK and create green sector jobs. The scheme closed in July 2015 after 30 months due to government concerns over low uptake and industry standards but additional factors potentially contributed to its failure such as poor scheme design and lack of understanding of the customer and supply chain journey. We explore the role of key delivery agents of GD services, specifically SMEs, and we use the LoCal-Net project as a case study to examine the use of networks to identify and reduce barriers to SME market engagement. We find that SMEs experienced multiple barriers to interaction with the GD such as lack of access to information, training, and confusion over delivery of the scheme but benefited from interaction with the network to access information, improve understanding of the scheme, increasing networking opportunities and forming new business models and partnerships to reduce risk. The importance of SMEs as delivery agents and their role in the design of market-led schemes such as the GD are discussed with recommendations for improving SME engagement in green sector initiatives.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING
AB  - This paper presents a novel reliable hierarchical location-allocation model where facilities are subject to the risk of disruptions. Based on the relationship between various levels of system, a multi-level multi-flow hierarchy is considered. The heterogeneous probabilistic disruptions are investigated in which the constructed facilities have different site-dependent and independent failure rates. In the occurrence of facility disruptions, to achieve system reliability, the mitigation operation is considered in such a way as to reassign the demand nodes to other operational facilities that can provide services. The problem is modeled from both cost and risk perspectives such that the fixed installation cost as well as the expected costs in normal disruption-free and disruptive conditions are minimized. A Benders decomposition algorithm is developed which seeks to find exact solution of the proposed model. Two efficient accelerating techniques including valid inequalities and knapsack inequalities are also proposed to expedite the convergence of solution procedure. The numerical results illustrate the applicability of the proposed model as well as the efficiency of the designed solution procedure.

AB  - Mobility is in a transition phase from individual human controlled to assisted and autonomous driving. Also, new roles add to car manufacturers being now forced to adapt to digital service providers as cars become the ultimate mobile office. Today, functional automotive requirements start to exceed on what's on the market accompanied with huge reliability assurance process gaps along the supply chain. Standards are out dated, research data unavailable and activities to change this strongly bound to market dynamics and mass volume requirements. This is why reliability engineering and management becomes a leading role in product design and business model formation. Transparency about technological gaps and how they are being handled determine market positions. To create industry awareness, we demonstrate two examples out of an OEM driven study on mechanical induced parametric deviations which relate to corresponding product verification/validation issues that can end up in real, but which are mostly classified as no fault found (NFF) issues.

AB  - An integrated mathematical framework for production planning is presented for companies providing product-warranty packages through both their forward and after-sales supply chains. This model integrates manufacturers and merchandisers of the pre- and after sales operations and incorporates the interactions between forward and after-sales chains. The demands and qualified output of facilities are stochastic. We demonstrate that service levels depend on the local reliability of facilities and that there are critical prices at which the order of profitability of the warranty options changes. This order becomes more fragile in price-sensitive markets and more stable in warranty-sensitive markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - The swift growth of e-commerce or e-tailing as a consumer retail channel has made it a serious competitor to traditional retail channels and is changing consumers' purchasing behaviour. The purpose of this case study, based on Target and Amazon.com, is to analyse the attributes of traditional retailing, e-tailing, and hybrid supply chain models to form conclusions about the feasibility of an idealised supply chain model for the future. An integrated and generalised modelling framework is used that incorporates Six Sigma - define, measure, analyse, improve, control methodology leveraging various tools, including process flow maps, cause and effect diagram, performance efficiency metrics, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), and Monte Carlo simulation. Based on this analysis and research, the conclusion is that the idealised supply chain of the future may evolve into a hybrid supply chain, which includes both e-tail and retail channels. The main recommendations from this study include assessing the risks of migrating to such a hybrid supply chain and to leverage the recommended actions provided in the hybrid FMEA. To facilitate more effective and mature processes, this study can guide researchers in exhaustive empirical evaluations of hybrid supply chains, gather experiences and lessons learned for practitioners.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PURCHASING AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Supply chain disruptions often led to declining sales, cost increases, and service failures for the company. Considering the profound impact of supply chain disruptions on business survivals, there is a need for formulating business initiatives that will make the company's supply chain network more resilient in the presence of risk and uncertainty. This paper sheds light on the inter-relationships among risk propensity, supply chain security practices, and disruption occurrence so that it can help the company figure out what it takes to overcome the company's vulnerability to supply chain risks and then gain competitive advantages over its rivals by better preparing for potential supply chain disruptions. This paper attempts to identify factors affecting the firm's risk behaviors and supply chain security practices based on the questionnaire survey of supply chain professionals. The finding indicates that firms which take the risk of supply chain disruption seriously are more likely to comply with security initiatives and build safety stocks and subsequently reduce the frequency of supply chain disruption occurrence.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT
AB  - Overbooking is widely applied in the service industry to hedge against undesirable situations, such as cancellations and no-shows. However, during the implementation of overbooking, service providers may turn down some customers when the number of arrivals exceeds their capacity on the target date. Therefore, this paper examines overbooking from the customers' perspective to offer them a clear perception on the possibility for their reservations to be denied by the service provider. By establishing a Stackelberg model between a service provider and an online travel agency, we explore how optimal overbooking strategy is developed by the service provider. Afterward, by analyzing the obtained optimal overbooking pad, we calculate the probabilities of denied service under different levels of monetary compensation that is paid to denied customers. A higher monetary compensation guarantees a higher chance of successful service. This paper also provides customers with some reference when booking services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Supply chain planning as one of the most important processes within the supply chain management concept, has a great impact on firms' success or failure. This paper considers a supply chain planning problem of an agile manufacturing company operating in a build-to-order environment under various kinds of uncertainty. An integrated optimization approach of procurement, production and distribution costs associated with the supply chain members has been taken into account. A robust optimization scenario-based approach is used to absorb the influence of uncertain parameters and variables. The formulation is a robust optimization model with the objective of minimizing the expected total supply chain cost while maintaining customer service level. The developed multi-product, multiperiod, multi-echelon robust mixed-integer linear programming model is then solved using the CPLEX optimization studio and guidance related to future areas of research is given.

AB  - Failure mode and effect analysis has been applied in manufacturing and service industries but can still be improved. Failure mode and effect analysis is a common tool used to evaluate risk priority number; however, numerous scholars have doubted the effectiveness of failure mode and effect analysis and have thus proposed methods for correcting failure mode and effect analysis from its conventional formula. Because implemented actions can determine or influence resource allocation and its effects, completing one corrective action can occasionally simultaneously improve various failure modes. In this study, failure mode and effect analysis and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory were integrated to correct failure modes and increase their effectiveness. First, failure mode and effect analysis was employed to identify the items for improvement. Second, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory was adopted to examine the reciprocal influences and causality among these items. Finally, the priority for improving the items was proposed. By combining the advantages of failure mode and effect analysis and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, this research method complemented the shortcomings of the two techniques. According to the empirical research of this case study in which decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory was employed to analyze the causality among the items of the failure modes, the malfunction of production lines can be solved faster and more effectively compared with merely considering the size of risk priority number values.

T2  - BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB  - Many retail and restaurant companies adopt international expansion as a strategy to take advantage of business opportunities presented by target markets. Common objectives include increasing revenue, escaping a hypercompetitive or saturated home market, entering an emerging or lucrative market, and leveraging domestic capabilities in a bordering country. Success in international expansion is not guaranteed, however; the business world is littered with failures. In this article, we examine the international expansion failures of five service companies that opened physical facilities in a foreign country: Target, Tim Hortons, Best Buy, Tesco, and Walmart. While a variety of factors led to these failures, some common causes have been identified. These include a lack of understanding of the purchasing characteristics of consumers, underestimation of the local competition, supply chain issues, and poor strategic decisions regarding facility location and the rate of expansion. Not all international expansions are failures, though, and herein we also present the success stories of Aldo, Carrefour, and Nordstrom. These companies understood customer preferences and focused on location issues and their supply chains. Based on the aforementioned failures and successes, we offer guidance for companies looking to expand their business operations via a physical presence in a foreign country.

AU  - Mengistie, Belay T.

T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Agricultural pesticides are important chemicals that are used to mitigate crop damage or loss and improve productivity. However, pesticides may cause negative environmental and human health effects depending on their specific distribution and use. Securing environmental safety and sustainability of pesticide distribution and use is widely seen as an important challenge for pesticide governance. This paper analyses how, why and under what circumstances Ethiopian pesticide supply chain actors deal with (un)safe distribution and use of pesticides and assesses their potential contribution to securing the quality, environmental safety and sustainability of pesticides importation, distribution and use. The framework developed for this is based on sustainable supply chain governance in order to assess the roles of and the interactions between the different chain actors, supporters and influencers. On the basis of field research in Ethiopia among key chain actors (importers, retailers, farmers) we analyse their involvement in three different environmental governance mechanisms: governing material flows of pesticides, managing information on health and environmental safety and providing training and capacity-building services. The study found the organisation of the pesticides supply chain in Ethiopia as atomistic. Environment and health hardly played a role in pesticides handling by the different supply chain actors, which was dominated by immediate profit motives. As a consequence smallholder farmers are put at risk because they are refrained from training, support or information provision on pesticides. Indeed, it was a failure of state governance that led importers and retailers to aggressive marketing and distributing pesticides unsafely and hinder the proliferate of private mode of governance. At the same time, a small signs of hope have also been identified at the supporters' and influencers' side of the chain. Successful environmental supply chain governance for safe pesticide distribution and use requires coordination and as well as training and information sharing (interaction) among pesticide supply chain actors, supporters and influencers at all levels-local, national and global as elements of one system of governance. Finally, the evidence presented in this paper suggests that due to limits in governmental capacity and concerns on commercial viability and on social and environmental impacts among private actors, there will be a role for private actors alongside public actors to ensure safe pesticide distribution and use. Public-private partnerships might constitute an attractive strategy for this aim. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Professional service supply chains
AU  - Harvey, Jean
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Professional service (PS) exchanges are seldom narrowly bounded in time and space. This conceptual paper discusses prolonged PS sequences involving different professionals and different types of professionals. It is framed by the dual concepts of service episodes, representing the client's perspective and experience, and PS supply chains, that is, organized sequences of professional, clerical, and technical services explicitly set up to provide specific results, such as producing a financial product, designing a house, or replacing a hip. Four illustrative, empirically inspired situations are used to characterize episodes and supply chains. Each exemplar, two each from the health and social work sectors, is real and draws on publicly available data. The richness of the public information is a reflection of the fact that each is some form of failure or “disaster” (Altay and Ramirez, 2010). This dual conceptualization leads to a holistic perspective obtained by using the complex adaptive systems framework (Dooley and Van de yen, 1999, Levin, 1998) as a lens. The paper concludes with a discussion of the dynamics of such service systems and some proposals for a research agenda. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AU  - Xu, Kefeng
AU  - Yin, Rui
AU  - Dong, Yan
T2  - DECISION SCIENCES
AB  - We examine how a supply chain firm may implement an incentive contract under inventory consignment to recover stockouts and to retain customers. Inventory consignment allows an upstream firm (e.g., a manufacturer) to own and control inventory at a downstream firm (e.g., a retailer), representing a structural change in supply chain governance. Motivated by cases in pet toy and electronics component industries, we formulate principal-agent models based on the newsvendor framework to capture the strategic interactions in a supply chain. We find that consignment can be effective in reducing stockouts because the ownership and control of the product by the manufacturer allows better prevention of stockouts, which complements stockout recovery and leads to fewer stockouts. However, the lower level of stockout under consignment does not necessarily translate into profitabilitywhen the manufacturer is highly opportunistic, that is, readily exploring outside opportunities for its product, consignment may lead to lower profitability for both the manufacturer and the supply chain. On the other hand, consignment will improve profitability for the manufacturer and the supply chain, if both the manufacturer opportunism and the retailer opportunism are moderate.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY
AB  - We build a model to analyse the benefit of upward channel decentralization for a firm choosing service outsourcing and integration. The key findings of this paper are as follows. First, we formulate an upward channel decentralization problem as a game incorporating consumer behaviour of willingness to pay in a channel duopoly. Our model considers (i) service quality, (ii) consumer marginal willingness to pay (MWTP), and (iii) consumer perceivable difference. A supply chain firm's preference of outsourcing strategy depends on the monotonicity of both the failure rate (or Mills Ratio) and CDF-PDF ratio of MWTP distribution function. Second, we use this model to explore the benefit of retailer strategy of upward channel decentralization. An equilibrium can be achieved by benefiting the low-label product with low quality service but deteriorating the high-label channel product with high quality.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB  - In this study, we examine the optimal allocation of demand across a set of suppliers in a supply chain that is exposed to supply risk and environmental risk. A two-stage mixed-integer programming model is used to develop a flexible sourcing strategy under disruptions. Our model integrates supplier selection and demand allocation with transportation channel selection and provides contingency plans to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions and minimise total network costs. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model and provide insights. The findings suggest that developing contingency plans using flexibility in suppliers' production capacity is an effective strategy for firms to mitigate the severity of disruptions. We also show that flexibility and reliability of the suppliers and regions play a significant role in determining contingency plans for during disruption. Findings generally show that highly flexible suppliers receive less allocation, and their flexible capacity is reserved for disruptions. For firms that do not incorporate risk management into supplier selection and allocation, the recommendation is to source from fewer, more reliable suppliers with less risk of disruption. Our findings also emphasise that the type of disruption has important implications for supplier selection and demand allocation. This study highlights the supply chain risk management strategy of regionalising as a means for minimising the impact of environmental disruptions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - There is significant potential for adding value by involving customer in the design process and delivery of logistic services. In order to add value to the overall logistic system, the purpose of this paper is to apply an integrated systems approach for the design of forward and reverse logistics services in order to build a self-organising service that can maximise efficiencies and in particular reduce reverse logistics costs. Design/methodology/approach - Two exploratory case studies were conducted in the logistics systems of housing repair and maintenance sector in the UK. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, observations, and documented evidence. Findings - The findings of the cross-case analysis suggests that systems approach expressed as the Vanguard Method (Seddon, 2008) has a direct impact on enhancing forward logistics performance and reducing reverse product flows by nourishing three dimensions for learning from demand-driven analysis; capturing customer clean information, demand predictability and categorisation, and failure demand analysis. Research limitations/implications - Findings from exploratory case studies cannot be easily generalised. Hence, further case studies are needed to enrich the findings, and to facilitate their industrial applications. Further, the paper explores the utilisation of the Vanguard Method only in the area of housing repairs and maintenance logistics services. It would be valuable for future studies to further investigate the utilisation of the Vanguard Method in other logistics services settings. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates an important dynamics of how logistics services can incorporate customer demands into the logistics design process.

Referring to this, critical infrastructures include “primary physical structures, technical facilities and systems whose disruption, failure or destruction have a serious impact on the functioning of society, the economy or the state within a natural hazard induced disaster context” (UNISDR 2011: 6). As a component of critical infrastructures, Food and especially the Food Supply is a significant part of the services for the public and fundamental for an effective Civil Security System. In this chapter primary definitions regarding Food as a critical infrastructure are depicted as the meaning of safeguarding the food supply in case of crisis or disaster situations emerges as critically important. Furthermore selected hazards and their impacts to the society are described.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the relationships among supply chain integration (SCI), supply chain service capabilities, market performance (MP), and financial performance (FP) in the container shipping context and develops valid and reliable instruments for future research. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 133 container shipping operators and agencies in Taiwan, using confirmatory factor analysis, the author identified main dimensions of SCI and supply chain service capabilities in container shipping context. A structural equation model was then used to test the research hypotheses. Findings - This study has identified a set of five dimensions that can enable effective SCI: top management support, cross-functional cooperation, information technology, goal congruence, and collaborative communication, and highlighted the critical mediating role of supply chain service capabilities (i.e. service efficiency, service reliability, service flexibility, and value-added service) in improving firms' market and FP. The authors confirm that SCI has a positive impact on supply chain service capabilities, which in turn helps to enhance market and FP. Practical implications - This research can thus serve as a valuable reference for managers to achieve better SCI formation and performance, help managers to develop more effective collaborative relationships, and thus minimize the chance of SCI failure. Originality/value - This manuscript provides a theoretical framework to link SCI, supply chain service capabilities, MP, and FP for the container shipping service supply chain context that have not been previously reported through empirical research.

TI  - Who's to blame or praise? Performance attribution challenges in outsourced service provision in supply chains
AU  - Selviaridis, Kostas
T2  - SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to understand the antecedents and effects of performance attribution challenges arising in the provision of business-to-business (B2B) services in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - The study draws on three in-depth case studies of logistics service providers (LSPs) offering supply chain solutions to their clients in Sweden. The analysis of performance attribution challenges and their antecedents and effects is based on 38 semi-structured interviews and review of 43 documents, including contracts and performance monitoring records. Findings - Three key antecedents of performance attribution challenges are stressed. Two of these, the inseparability and contestability of service inputs, are closely related to the notion of service co-production. The third antecedent is the limited provider capability in performance data collection and analysis. Performance attribution challenges may result in provider aversion to performance-related risk and have a harmful effect on client relationships, for example, in terms of provider perceptions of opportunism and unfair allocation of gains. These effects can be mitigated through contracting, interventions in performance measurement system design and deployment of relational mechanisms. Research limitations/implications - The paper extends the service management literature that emphasises on service co-production by suggesting that inputs of the client firm and its supply chain partners may not only vary in quality but also can be inseparable from provider inputs and highly contestable. It also empirically demonstrates how performance attribution challenges and their antecedents and effects manifest themselves in B2B service provision, as opposed to supply chain settings where the main user of logistics services is the consumer. Practical implications - LSP managers should contract for performance based on high-quality and incontestable external inputs they rely upon. Contractual specifications (performance indicators and related incentives) should explicate and consider the inputs required by clients and their supply chain partners to minimise their contestability. Originality/value - The study proposes an empirically based framework of the antecedents and effects of performance attribution challenges, an issue that has received scant attention in logistics outsourcing research and the business services literature more broadly.

AB  - Regenerative technologies strive to boost innate repair processes and restitute normative impact. Deployment of regenerative principles into practice is poised to usher in a new era in health care, driving radical innovation in patient management to address the needs of an aging population challenged by escalating chronic diseases. There is urgency to design, execute, and validate viable paradigms for translating and implementing the science of regenerative medicine into tangible health benefits that provide value to stakeholders. A regenerative medicine model of care would entail scalable production and standardized application of clinical grade biotherapies supported by comprehensive supply chain capabilities that integrate sourcing and manufacturing with care delivery. Mayo Clinic has rolled out a blueprint for discovery, translation, and application of regenerative medicine therapies for accelerated adoption into the standard of care. To establish regenerative medical and surgical service lines, the Mayo Clinic model incorporates patient access, enabling platforms and delivery. Access is coordinated through a designated portal, the Regenerative Medicine Consult Service, serving to facilitate patient/provider education, procurement of biomaterials, referral to specialty services, and/or regenerative interventions, often in clinical trials. Platforms include the Regenerative Medicine Biotrust and Good Manufacturing Practice facilities for manufacture of clinical grade products for cell-based, acellular, and/or biomaterial applications. Care delivery leverages dedicated interventional suites for provision of regenerative services. Performance is tracked using a scorecard system to inform decision making. The Mayo Clinic roadmap exemplifies an integrated organization in the discovery, development, and delivery of regenerative medicine within a growing community of practice at the core of modern health care.

AB  - This joint position paper of the 3 medical societies Association of Acute Care Hospitals with Acute Care Rehabilitation Departments (BAG Fruhre-habilitation), German Specialist Society of Physical and Rehabilitative Medicine (BVPRM), and German Scientific Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (DGPMR) displays the current status, the perspectives, and measures for the future development of the interdisciplinary acute care rehabilitation. Acute care rehabilitation is the earliest onset of rehabilitative intervention during acute hospital care. It can be seen as the first link in a chain of rehabilitation interventions. At the same time it is an integral and legally required part of the acute care. The significance and necessity of acute care rehabilitation is increasing due to demographic and technical developments in medicine. International directives (WHO, EU) and national legislation confer the right of access to acute care rehabilitation. The position paper differentiates between interdisciplinary acute care rehabilitation and early mobilisation as well as post-acute rehabilitation. Moreover it categorises interdisciplinary acute care rehabilitation in the context of other distinct forms of acute care rehabilitation. Independent acute rehabilitation units and decentralised acute rehabilitation teams are the major concepts how acute care rehabilitation services are provided. The paper characterises frequently observed goals of interdisciplinary acute rehabilitation as well as its structural and procedural requirements. Indication and contraindication criteria are derived from typical patient clusters. An analysis of the national and regional supply of acute care rehabilitation services are compared to estimations of the need. The DRG-system-based reimbursement of acute care rehabilitation is discussed, as it does not adequately compensate for the consumption of resources. Fundamental demands and a catalogue of specific proposals are derived from the analyses. The existing structures of interdisciplinary acute care rehabilitation should be further supported. As legally demanded, structures should be implemented to ensure an appropriate supply with acute care rehabilitation services.

AB  - Background: Maternal mortality remains a daunting problem in Mozambique and many other low-resource countries. High quality antenatal care (ANC) services can improve maternal and newborn health outcomes and increase the likelihood that women will seek skilled delivery care. This study explores the factors influencing provider uptake of the recommended package of ANC interventions in Mozambique. Methods: This study used qualitative research methods including key informant interviews with stakeholders from the health sector and a total of five focus group discussions with women with experience with ANC or women from the community. Study participants were selected from three health centers located in Maputo city, Tete, and Cabo Delgado provinces in Mozambique. Staff responsible for the medicines/supply chain at national, provincial and district level were interviewed. A check list was implemented to confirm the availability of the supplies required for ANC. Deductive content analysis was conducted. Results: Three main groups of factors were identified that hinder the implementation of the ANC package in the study setting: a) system or organizational: include chronic supply chain deficiencies, failures in the continuing education system, lack of regular audits and supervision, absence of an efficient patient record system and poor environmental conditions at the health center; b) health care provider factors: such as limited awareness of current clinical guidelines and a resistant attitude to adopting new recommendations; and c) Users: challenges with accessing ANC, poor recognition amongst women about the purpose and importance of the specific interventions provided through ANC, and widespread perception of an unfriendly environment at the health center. Conclusions: The ANC package in Mozambique is not being fully implemented in the three study facilities, and a major barrier is poor functioning of the supply chain system. Recommendations for improving the implementation of antenatal interventions include ensuring clinical protocols based on the ANC model. Increasing the community understanding of the importance of ANC would improve demand for high quality ANC services. The supply chain functioning could be strengthened through the introduction of a kit system with all the necessary supplies for ANC and a simple monitoring system to track the stock levels is recommended.

TI  - Generating a causal model of supply chain collaboration using the fuzzy DEMA℡ technique
AU  - Jeng, Don Jyh-Fu
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Supply chain collaboration is usually adopted by manufacturers as a strategic measure to increase overall supply chain performance. However, such collaborations arguably have the highest failure record of the various supply chain management practices that are currently being applied. Part of the problem has been the uncertain external environment, an overreliance on technology, and lack of trust among partners. Based on Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Relational Exchange Theory (RET), it is clear that environment, asset specificity, and trust are key determinants for the success of collaborations among firms. However, the fuzziness of the interdependency among these determinants and their influences on supply chain collaborative processes still remains unknown. This study thus focuses on Taiwanese manufacturing firms as an example case, and empirically probes the relationships among these dimensions and their effects on these processes. To accommodate the vagueness of human opinions, the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMA℡) technique is applied to examine this issue, and to produce a causal relations map. This study also provides a discussion and insights for supply chain practitioners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PURCHASING AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Often it is commercial, not technological, factors which hinder the adoption of potentially valuable innovations. In energy policy, much attention is given to analysing and incentivising consumer demand for renewable energy, but new technologies may also need new supply markets, to provide products and services to build, operate and maintain the innovative technology. This paper addresses the impact of supply constraints on the long-term viability of sustainability related innovations, using the case of bioenergy from organic waste. Uncertainties in the pricing and availability of feedstock (i.e. waste) may generate market deadlock and deter potential investors. We draw on prior research to conceptualise the problem, and identify what steps might be taken to address it. We propose a research agenda aimed at purchasing and supply scholars and centred on the need to understand better the interplay between market evolution and supply uncertainty and `market shaping' - how stakeholders can legitimately influence supply market evolution - to support the adoption of sustainability related innovation.

T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Extreme weather events can cause severe disruption to transport systems, greatly reducing the ability to maintain important social and economic functions such as the delivery of goods and materials within the supply chain. There is a need for greater qualitative and quantitative understanding of how transport systems respond under adverse conditions, to inform event management and to aid adaptation actions. The present study uses the intense storms of 28 June 2012 as a case study to present a novel exploration of the impacts of an extreme event using high spatial and temporal resolution transport data for the UK road and rail networks, as well as weather data from the UK Meteorological Office's MIDAS surface station network and NIMROD weather radar. This event caused widespread disruption, severing the main rail links between England and Scotland and causing 10000 delay minutes to train services throughout the country, as well as causing reduced speeds on local roads and motorways. The present study describes the meteorological situation in the build-up to and during the event, and uses Network Rail train delay data to visualize the way in which the failure of several sections of critical transport infrastructure caused disruption that propagated quickly through the rail network of Great Britain. Highway Agency motorway speed data are used to quantify the impact of this event on the M6 motorway in the West Midlands. Ways in which the insights gained from these data can be used to aid the transport sector in the prioritization of adaptation actions are discussed.

T2  - INTERFACES
AB  - A lean enterprise ties together and synchronizes all elements of its value-delivery system to provide for the needs of target customers. Organizations applying lean concepts in a systematic manner have been highly successful from operational, market, and financial perspectives. Once effectively in place, however, lean value-delivery systems can be more easily derailed than their leaders imagine, particularly in turbulent times. We identify three potential challenges for lean enterprises: (1) locked operating model: failure to change the value-delivery system in response to market and economic disruptions; (2) backward drift to pre-lean practices: regression toward wasteful inventory accumulations, backlogs, and complexity; (3) lean islands: isolation of lean practices within the walls of the company. Our observations at Quadrant Homes as it navigated the Great Recession, supplemented by our research at other companies, leads to recommendations for lean organizations to apply in countering these challenges.

T2  - PROBABILISTIC ENGINEERING MECHANICS
AB  - Complex technological networks designed for distribution of some resource or commodity are a pervasive feature of modern society. Moreover, the dependence of our society on modern technological networks constantly grows. As a result, there is an increasing demand for these networks to be highly reliable in delivering their service. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for efficient computational methods that can quantitatively assess the reliability of technological networks to enhance their design and operation in the presence of uncertainty in their future demand, supply and capacity. In this paper, we propose a stochastic framework for quantitative assessment of the reliability of network service, formulate a general network reliability problem within this framework, and then show how to calculate the service reliability using Subset Simulation, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method that was originally developed for estimating small failure probabilities of complex dynamic systems. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated with an illustrative example where two small-world network generation models are compared in terms of the maximum-flow reliability of the networks that they produce.

T2  - DRUGS
AB  - Health behaviors such as retention in HIV medical care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) pose major challenges to reducing new HIV infections, addressing health disparities, and improving health outcomes. Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use provides a conceptual framework for understanding how patient and environmental factors affect health behaviors and outcomes, which can inform the design of intervention strategies. Factors affecting retention and adherence among persons with HIV include patient predisposing factors (e.g., mental illness, substance abuse), patient-enabling factors (e.g., social support, reminder strategies, medication characteristics, transportation, housing, insurance), and healthcare environment factors (e.g., pharmacy services, clinic experiences, provider characteristics). Evidence-based recommendations for improving retention and adherence include (1) systematic monitoring of clinic attendance and ART adherence; (2) use of peer or paraprofessional navigators to re-engage patients in care and help them remain in care; (3) optimization of ART regimens and pharmaceutical supply chain management systems; (4) provision of reminder devices and tools; (5) general education and counseling; (6) engagement of peer, family, and community support groups; (7) case management; and (8) targeting patients with substance abuse and mental illness. Further research is needed on effective monitoring strategies and interventions that focus on improving retention and adherence, with specific attention to the healthcare environment.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SIMULATION MODELLING
AB  - With the development of science and technology, laptop becomes very popular. Laptop manufacturing firms are concerning how much spare parts they shall prepare to meet the demand of repairing. The quantities of spare parts are not only related to laptop life time, but also concern with users' repair willingness. We propose an approach to calculate the repair probability of laptop parts combined Poisson Process with users' repair willingness. In this study, the users' repair willingness relates laptop parts failure frequency. The new approach's verification is carried on by simulation. The significant test results show that simulation data fit theoretical value very well. By survey data and simulation result, we find that after four times broken for a laptop, a user will give up repairing it. The calculation result of new approach shows that spare parts quantities are entirely lower than traditional theory. From this point, if laptop manufacturers know their each parts lifetime, with the help of this paper, they can cut down their spare parts and save their service costs reasonable than before.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesNHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) and the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) are national blood establishments providing blood components to England and North Wales, and Australia, respectively. In 2012, both services experienced potentially catastrophic challenges to key assets. NHSBT suffered a flood that closed the largest blood-manufacturing centre in Europe, whilst ARCBS experienced the failure of a data centre network switch that rendered the national blood management system inaccessible for 42h. This paper describes both crisis events, including the immediate actions, recovery procedures and lessons learned. Materials and MethodsBoth incidents triggered emergency response plans. These included hospital reprovisioning and recovery from the incident. Once normal services had been restored, both events were subjected to root cause analysis (RCA) and production of lessons learned' reports. ResultsIn both scenarios, the key enablers of rapid recovery were established emergency plans, clear leadership and the support of a flexible workforce. Product issues to hospitals were unaffected, and there were no abnormal trends in hospital complaints. RCA identified the importance of risk mitigations that require co-operation with external organizations. Reviews of both events identified opportunities to enhance business resilience through prior identification of external risks and improvements to contingency plans, for example by implementing mass messaging to staff and other stakeholders. ConclusionsBlood establishment emergency plans tend to focus on responding to mass casualty events. However, consolidation of manufacturing to fewer sites combined with a reliance on national IT systems increases the impact of loss of function. Blood services should develop business continuity plans which include prevention of such losses, and the maintenance of services and disaster recovery.

T2  - WATER SA
AB  - All water services systems, irrespective of size, location etc., should have emergency response plans (ERPs) to guide officials, stakeholders and consumers through emergencies, as part of managing risks in the water supply system. Emergencies in the water supply system may result from, among other causes, natural disasters, equipment failure, human error and intentional acts (e.g. vandalism). Simply put, an ERP prepares the organisation for emergencies and gives specific instructions about what to do if there is an emergency situation that may affect the water system. To assist water services institutions (WSIs), the Water Research Commission project `Water Safety and Security: Emergency Response Plans' aimed to develop a generic ERP guide for community water systems (CWS). A CWS in this study was defined as a potable water service provided to a rural community where municipal constraints exist and there is either `no supply' or water is provided up to a communal standpipe. Emergencies considered in this study include (i) unavailability of water or (ii) excess of water (e.g. flood) and (iii) water quality or pollution/contamination. CWS in 3 provinces in South Africa (Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Northern Cape), were visited to (i) identify the water service delivery status, methods and possible shared threats/vulnerabilities and risks (ii) identify water services challenges experienced by these communities (iii) ascertain who owns and who is responsible for water services (e.g. whether these communities are serviced by municipalities or by local chiefs and/or trusts) and (iv) investigate whether the systems have been documented and evaluated. Following site visits, an ERP guideline document with associated templates will be developed and workshopped with the selected communities, which will include: (i) conditions identified as emergencies, (ii) communication procedures/protocol/chain of command, and ( iii) procedures detailing how to attend to the specified emergencies.

T2  - BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a simulation modelling framework to examine the behaviour of a serial make-to-stock (MTS) manufacturing system under the influence of various uncertainties. Further, the study analyses effect of propagation uncertainties from lower to upper stream of supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - System dynamics modelling approach has been adopted for modelling and analysing the behaviour of a serial MTS manufacturing system under the influence of different uncertainties such as demand, supplier acquisition rate, raw material (RM) supply lead time, processing time and delay due to machine failure. The backup supply strategy has been proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of the RM supply uncertainty. Findings - The effect of variations of various factors on the performance of a MTS manufacturing supply chain in measured through various performance measures like work-in-progress (WIP) inventory, backlog and RM shortage at both manufacturer's and supplier's end. The benefit of adopting backup supply strategy under RM supply uncertainty is demonstrated. Research limitations/implications - This work is limited to analysis of a serial MTS manufacturing system dealing with a single product having two machines only. The study can be easily extended to a more complex system with multiple machines, lines and products. Practical implications - A simple simulation framework has been proposed to analyse the effect of various uncertainties on the performance of a MTS manufacturing system. The managers can simulate complex systems using simulation approaches to generate if-then scenarios to gain insight into practical problems and formulate strategies to mitigate adverse effect of uncertainties at various level of supply chain. Originality/value - The study analyses behaviour of MTS manufacturing system under the effect of various uncertainties operating simultaneously in the system. A backup supplier strategy is proposed to improve the service level at the customer's end through improving service level at the supplier's end. Similarly, effective strategies can be tested with the proposed simple model to reduce the effect of uncertainty at different levels of the supply chain.

AB  - With the increasing call for green cloud, reducing energy consumption has been an important requirement for cloud resource providers not only to reduce operating costs, but also to improve system reliability. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been a key technique in exploiting the hardware characteristics of cloud datacenters to save energy by lowering the supply voltage and operating frequency. This paper presents a novel stochastic framework for energy efficiency and performance analysis of DVS-enabled cloud. This framework uses virtual machine request arrival rate, failure rate, repair rate, and service rate of datacenter servers as model inputs. Based on a queuing-network-based analysis, this paper gives analytic solutions of three metrics. The proposed framework can be used to help the design and optimization of energy-aware high performance cloud systems.

AU  - Swink, Morgan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - In an effort to further explain why manufacturing firms that move towards service provision often do not achieve the financial benefits they would expect, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of service additions on the risks affecting the firm. Design/methodology/approach - Using data drawn from a sample 129 bankrupt manufacturers (75 servitized and 54 non-servitized) and a categorization framework of failure risks, the study explores the impact of the presence of a service business on environmental and internal bankruptcy risks that a manufacturing firm must face. Findings -The study finds that the presence of a service business leads to a greater number of bankruptcy risks for the supplying firm. This is essentially because of greater internal risks. In addition, two types of service offerings are identified - demand chain and product support services. When firms offer demand chain services, they are also exposed to greater environmental risks. Research limitations/implications - The study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between servitization and bankruptcy risks, and on how this is influenced by the type of service offering. The research should be extended by a more comprehensive assessment of organizational risks in order to further validate and develop the conclusions. Practical implications - The study suggests that, as adding services introduces new risks for firms, managers have to seek means of mitigating these risks to ensure successful introduction of services. Originality/value - The paper addressed the gap in the literature for structured analyses of the risk consequences of service strategies.

TI  - Disaster risk assessment of ports based on the perspective of vulnerability
AU  - Hsieh, Cheng-Hsien
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
AB  - Global environmental changes have led to frequent occurrences of climatic extremes. The increasingly frequent and high-magnitude natural disasters in Taiwan have caused significant mortality, injury, and property damage. In response, there have been requests to improve the capacity to cope with extreme climatic conditions through increased awareness and identification of vulnerability. Disruptions to transportation systems affect the resilience for sustaining daily operations. Among the various types of transportation systems, ports provide substantial employment and industrial activity, contributing to national and regional development. In addition, ports integrate the functions of supply chains such as services in logistics, information, and business, becoming the location of industrial clusters. Therefore, this study examines the risk of port failures from the perspective of vulnerability. Specifically, seven vulnerable factors derived from the extant literature and lessons learned from the previous disaster cases are evaluated using geographic information systems. The results reveal that port capacity and efficiency have a significant effect on port vulnerability in which the efficiency of gantry cranes, labor productivity, free trade zone business volume, and ground access networks play crucial roles in port failure. Moreover, the risks associated with port operation are evaluated by overlapping a hazard map of areas prone to debris flows and tsunami inundation. The risk maps can assist decision makers in understanding the vulnerability and adopting appropriate strategies to minimize disaster risks.

AB  - Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been reported to be a risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease. Although the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the most commonly used measure of OSA, other less well studied OSA-related variables may be more pathophysiologically relevant and offer better prediction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between OSA-related variables and risk of CV events. Methods and Findings A historical cohort study was conducted using clinical database and health administrative data. Adults referred for suspected OSA who underwent diagnostic polysomnography at the sleep laboratory at St Michael's Hospital (Toronto, Canada) between 1994 and 2010 were followed through provincial health administrative data (Ontario, Canada) until May 2011 to examine the occurrence of a composite outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, revascularization procedures, or death from any cause). Cox regression models were used to investigate the association between baseline OSA-related variables and composite outcome controlling for traditional risk factors. The results were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs; for continuous variables, HRs compare the 75th and 25th percentiles. Over a median follow-up of 68 months, 1,172 (11.5%) of 10,149 participants experienced our composite outcome. In a fully adjusted model, other than AHI OSA-related variables were significant independent predictors: time spent with oxygen saturation <90% (9 minutes versus 0; HR=1.50, 95% CI 1.25-1.79), sleep time (4.9 versus 6.4 hours; HR=1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.27), awakenings (35 versus 18; HR=1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10), periodic leg movements (13 versus 0/hour; HR=1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07), heart rate (70 versus 56 beats per minute [bpm]; HR=1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.37), and daytime sleepiness (HR=1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.28).The main study limitation was lack of information about continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence. Conclusion OSA-related factors other than AHI were shown as important predictors of composite CV outcome and should be considered in future studies and clinical practice.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary Editors' Summary Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder, particularly among middle-aged and elderly people. It is characterized by apneaa brief interruption in breathing that lasts at least 10 secondsand hypopneaa decrease of more than 50% in the amplitude of breathing that lasts at least 10 seconds or clear but smaller decrease in amplitude associated with either oxygen desaturation or an arousal. Patients with OSA experience numerous episodes of apnea and hypopnea during the night; severe OSA is defined as having 30 or more episodes per hour (an apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] of >30). These breathing interruptions occur when relaxation of the upper airway muscles decreases the airflow, which lowers the amount of oxygen in the blood. As a result, affected individuals frequently wake from deep sleep as they struggle to breathe. Symptoms of OSA include loud snoring and daytime sleepiness. Treatments include lifestyle changes such as losing weight (excess fat around the neck increases airway collapse) and smoking cessation. For severe OSA, doctors recommend continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), in which a machine blows pressurized air through a face mask into the airway to keep it open. Why Was This Study Done? OSA can be life-threatening. Most directly, daytime sleepiness can cause accidents, but OSA is also associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD, disease that affects the heart and the circulation). To date, studies that have investigated the association between OSA and the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), congestive heart failure, stroke, and other CVDs have used the AHI to diagnose and categorize the severity of OSA. However, by focussing on AHI, clinicians and researchers may be missing opportunities to improve their ability to predict which patients are at the highest risk of CVD. In this historical cohort study, the researchers investigate the association between other OSA-related variables (for example, blood oxygen saturation and sleep fragmentation) and the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality (death). A historical cohort study examines the medical records of groups of individuals who have different characteristics at baseline for the subsequent occurrence of specific outcomes. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers used administrative data (including hospitalization records and physicians' claims for services supplied to patients) to follow up adults referred for suspected OSA who underwent diagnostic polysomnography (a sleep study) at a single Canadian hospital between 1994 and 2010. A database of the polysomnography results provided information on OSA-related variables for all the study participants. Over an average follow-up of about 6 years, 11.5% of the 10,149 participants were hospitalized for a myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure, underwent a revascularization procedure (an intervention that restores the blood supply to an organ or tissue after CVD has blocked a blood vessel), or had died from any cause. After adjusting for multiple established risk factors for CVD such as smoking and age in Cox regression models (a statistical approach that examines associations between patient variables and outcomes), several OSA-related variables (but not AHI) were significant predictors of CVD. The strongest OSA-related predictor of cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality was total sleep time spent with oxygen saturation below 90%, which increased the risk of a cardiovascular event or death by 50%. Other statistically significant OSA-related predictors (predictors that were unlikely to be associated with the outcome through chance) of cardiovascular events or death included total sleep time, number of awakenings, frequency of periodic leg movements, heart rate, and daytime sleepiness. What Do These Findings Mean? These findings indicate that OSA-related factors other than AHI are important predictors of the composite outcome of a cardiovascular event or all-cause mortality. Indeed, although AHI was significantly associated with the researchers' composite outcome in an analysis that did not consider other established risk factors for CVD (confounders), the association became non-significant after controlling for potential confounders. The accuracy of these findings, which need to be confirmed in other settings, is likely to be limited by the lack of information available about the use of CPAP by study participants and by the lack of adjustment for some important confounders. Importantly, however, these findings suggest that OSA-related factors other than AHI should be considered as predictors of CVD in future studies and in clinical practice.

T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Providing good solid waste management (SWM) services while also ensuring financial sustainability of the system continues to be a major challenge in cities of developing countries. Bahir Dar in northwestern Ethiopia outsourced municipal waste services to a private waste company in 2008. While this institutional change has led to substantial improvement in the cleanliness of the city, its financial sustainability remains unclear. Is the private company able to generate sufficient revenues from their activities to offset the costs and generate some profit? This paper presents a cost-revenue analysis, based on data from July 2009 to June 2011. The analysis reveals that overall costs in Bahir Dar's SWM system increased significantly during this period, mainly due to rising costs related to waste transportation. On the other hand, there is only one major revenue stream in place: the waste collection fee from households, commercial enterprises and institutions. As the efficiency of fee collection from households is only around 50%, the total amount of revenues are not sufficient to cover the running costs. This results in a substantial yearly deficit. The results of the research therefore show that a more detailed cost structure and cost-revenue analysis of this waste management service is important with appropriate measures, either by the privates sector itself or with the support of the local authorities, in order to enhance cost efficiency and balance the cost-revenues towards cost recovery. Delays in mitigating the evident financial deficit could else endanger the public-private partnership (PPP) and lead to failure of this setup in the medium to long term, thus also endangering the now existing improved and currently reliable service. We present four options on how financial sustainability of the SWM system in Bahir Dar might be enhanced: (i) improved fee collection efficiency by linking the fees of solid waste collection to water supply; (ii) increasing the value chain by sales of organic waste recycling products; (iii) diversifying revenue streams and financing mechanisms (polluter-pays-, cross-subsidy- and business-principles); and (iv) cost reduction and improved cost-effectiveness. We argue that in a PPP setup such as in Bahir Dar, a strong alliance between the municipality and private enterprise is important so that appropriate solutions for improved financial sustainability of a SWM system can be sought and implemented.

AB  - This chapter introduces the reader to Supply Chain Network Design (SCND) models that include the Cost Of Quality (COQ) among the relevant costs. In contrast to earlier models, the COQ is computed internally as a function of decisions taken as part of the design of the supply chain. Earlier models assume exogenously given COQ functions. Background information is provided on previous COQ modeling and on supply chain network design models. The authors' COQ modeling is described in detail as is the SCND model that incorporates COQ. The COQ modeling includes prevention, appraisal, and both internal and external failure costs. Solution methods based on metaheuristics such as simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm are provided, including details on parameter tuning and computational testing. A genetic algorithm was found to yield the best results, followed by the simulated annealing approach. Topics for further research are provided as well as an extensive list of references for further reading.

AU  - Ehrenthal, Joachim C. F.

AU  - Hofstetter, Joerg S.
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the effects of retail out-of-stocks from a service-dominant (S-D) logic view. Design/methodology/approach - Conceptual, combining classic S-D logic research with recent research of S-D logic in supply chains, and applying this to out-of-stocks in a retail setting of fast-moving consumer goods. Findings - The paper unveils out-of-stocks as emergent operant resources that alter and attenuate value creation across manufacturers, retailers, shoppers, users and their networks. The paper develops a model of value co-creation where manufacturer supply and shopper/user demand meet in the retailer's realm. Differentiating between shopper and user in a sequential model of value creation, it identifies the shopper as an active entity whose response to out-of-stocks redistributes value within the retail service ecosystem. An additional model is developed that illustrates the novel costs of an out-of-stock as uncovered by the S-D logic perspective, allowing retailers and manufacturers to align their interests in improving on-shelf availability. Research limitations/implications - Moving distribution thought and management towards a goal of service provision, this article suggests three logistics research possibilities: retailer-manufacturer misalignment, spatio-temporal supply-demand mismatch, and shopper-user interaction. Practical implications - This article shows how the S-D perspective can bring previously misaligned incentives of supply chain actors into alignment. Previous goods-dominant research showed little common ground for manufacturers and retailers to jointly improve on-shelf availability. The S-D logic view demonstrates compelling rationale for both parties' involvement. Originality/value - The paper extends S-D logic literature by considering value attenuation through failures in physical distribution and logistics management, adding that non-availability causes operand resources to become operant and attenuate/redistribute value. The paper extends the out-of-stock literature by providing a theoretical foundation, and by showing the ecosystem effects of out-of-stocks.

AB  - We propose an integrated model of the asset management decisions for a fleet of identical product units and the inventory management decisions for a closed-loop supply chain in the context of a product-service system, in which the two types of decisions are closely coupled. A joint optimization technique is developed to obtain the parameters of the operational policy for the integrated model that minimize the long run average cost rate. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the computational procedures. In addition, the effect of a simplifying assumption that the replaced products have no quality difference is evaluated and the results suggest that as long as the quality difference between the preventively replaced products and failure replaced products is not too big, the simplification to treat them as one category is reasonable.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB  - This study focuses on collaboratively designing a structured and comprehensive supply chain (SC) network management key processes model and analyzing the relative importance of these key processes for semiconductor industry. The collaborative design and analysis are performed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of over 20 members from both academia and industry. This research is based on experiences of these team members who joined a successful e-SCM project, used as a case study in this research, between the world's largest semiconductor foundry and the world's largest assembly and testing service provider. This study adopts focus group methodology for collaborative design and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for collaborative analysis. The result of the design is a structured and comprehensive key processes model consisting of four dimensions: strategy and planning, manufacturing, logistics, and risk management (SMLR) with a total of 15 key processes included in these four dimensions. The resulting weightings from FAHP analysis can identify the most critical one dimension and four key processes since they account for approximately half of the overall weighting in their level. The SMLR model provides a structured and comprehensive reference model for future SC network management project executives, ensuring that all key processes are supported to avoid extremely costly failure. The resulting weightings provide these managers with the relative importance of these key processes and can help them make critical decisions in allocating limited resources to support the most critical processes. To confirm the results and further explore the managerial implications, a second session of focus group meeting was conducted and practices of the top three key processes in the semiconductor manufacturing industry were used to illustrate what actions can be performed to improve these processes and hence benefit the entire SC network. The research results can serve as a foundation for related academic researches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimizing designs and operations of a single network or multiple interdependent infrastructures under stochastic arc disruption
AU  - Shen, Siqian
T2  - COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB  - In this paper, we consider an infrastructure as a network with supply, transshipment, and demand nodes. A subset of potential arcs can be constructed between node pairs for conveying service flows. The paper studies two optimization models under stochastic arc disruption. Model 1 focuses on a single network with small-scale failures, and repairs arcs for quick service restoration. Model 2 considers multiple interdependent infrastructures under large-scale disruptions, and mitigates cascading failures by selectively disconnecting failed components. We formulate both models as scenario-based stochastic mixed-integer programs, in which the first-stage problem builds arcs, and the second-stage problem optimizes recourse operations for restoring service or mitigating losses. The goal is to minimize the total cost of infrastructure design and recovery operations. We develop cutting-plane algorithms and several heuristic approaches for solving the two models. Model 1 is tested on an IEEE 118-bus system. Model 2 is tested on systems consisting of the 118-bus system, a 20-node network, and/or a 50-node network, with randomly generated interdependency sets in three different topological forms (i.e., chain, tree, and cycle). The computational results demonstrate that (i) decomposition and cutting-plane algorithms effectively solve Model 1, and (ii) heuristic approaches dramatically decrease the CPU time for Model 2, but yield worse bounds when cardinalities of interdependency sets increase. Future research includes developing special algorithms for optimizing Model 2 for complex multiple infrastructures with special topological forms of system interdependency. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Dealing disruptions has increasingly attracted researchers' attention in the last decades due to recent events: weather deregulation, natural disasters, financial crisis, etc. Researchers often dealt with the strategic aspect of the problem while making facility location decisions to build a robust supply chain. In this paper we address the flexibility aspect. We consider the problem of allocating demand arising from a set of products to a set of dedicated facilities. The facilities are subject to disruption and the demand is then lost. To mitigate disruption impacts, we consider the use of a super facility that can hold the demand of products when the dedicated facilities are under failure. In systems with identical products and facilities, we propose an algorithm that can be used to determine the optimal capacity of the super facility so as to minimize the sum of capacity investment, demand allocation and lost sales cost. Finally we compare the performance of the super facility configuration to that of the single chain configuration. The single chain refers to a facility configuration where each facility is configured to fulfill only two products and each product can be assigned to only two facilities and the whole system forms a closed chain.

T2  - AUDITING-A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY
AB  - Accounting firms have steadily increased the use of outsourcing and offshoring of professional services including independent audit procedures. While firms suggest that the work is of higher quality and similar litigation risk, questions remain as to whether public perceptions may be more negative. This paper examines liability associated with an audit failure when work is performed by another office of the same firm or outsourced to a separate firm, and whether the work is performed domestically or in another country. Results indicate main effects for outsourcing on compensatory damages and an interaction between outsourcing and offshoring on punitive damages. Surprisingly, jurors assess higher than expected litigation awards for a failure by another domestic office of the firm for punitive damages. This result suggests that the close proximity in terms of both geography and organizational distance of the domestic office of the firm leads jurors to find the audit failure less understandable. Post hoc analyses indicate that potential jurors perceive that work completed by another domestic office of the firm has the highest expected quality and lowest risk, while work that is outsourced offshore is expected to be lowest quality and highest risk-consistent with proximity theory.

T2  - CRITICAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND RESILIENCE IN THE ICT SECTOR
AB  - Advancements of information and communication technologies (ICT) cause infrastructure owners to augment current infrastructures with such ICT. The creation of more efficient and effective end-user services provides economical benefits and increases customer satisfaction. Concurrently, ICT advancements allow governmental and industrial sectors to develop complete new infrastructures and infrastructure services, the so called Next Generation Infrastructures (NGI). NGI will offer new services to society, end-users and the supply-chain of organisations and linked, dependent infrastructural services. For over fifty years, the introduction of new ICT-based services and infrastructures has been tightly coupled with failures in ICT-security. This chapter on NGI discusses the root causes of these security failures. Based on historical experiences, this chapter predicts threats and cyber security failures alike for the envisioned NGI such as smart (energy) grids, smart road transport infrastructure, smart cities, and e-health. This prediction will become reality unless fundamental changes in the approach to security of ICT-based and ICT-controlled infrastructures are taken.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - The importance of innovation is widely accepted but a continuing challenge for research and practice is how to enable the process. Extensive discussion around the theme of `dynamic capabilities' highlights the fact that organization-level learning processes are central to this. The ability to deliver a continuing stream of innovations to the market place, or to introduce a regular flow of process improvements depends on sustained search and experiment but also on the ability to extract and embed key behavioural routines which support innovation. This highlights a central issue for `policy agents' of various kinds-regional and national government, trade and sector associations, large supply chain `owners', etc.-who share a concern with enabling higher levels of innovation performance across their constituencies. What might be done to help firms generate and launch new products and services which drive growth and bring in new or improved processes which enhance productivity? The nature of the challenge is not (simply) the promotion of entrepreneurial behaviour to exploit a particular new market opportunity or the adoption of a single key new technology. Rather it is to facilitate the development of capabilities within target organizations to manage the process of innovation for themselves. This article focuses on one policy option-the mobilization of shared learning among formally configured groups of organizations in peer-to-peer learning networks. These form an increasingly important channel within innovation support policy and in the article, we explore the underlying rationale for such modes of intervention and try to identify some of the dynamics of successful and less successful learning networks.

T2  - PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - We study the design of extended warranties in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an independent retailer. The manufacturer produces a single product and sells it exclusively through the retailer. The extended warranty can be offered either by the manufacturer or by the retailer. The party offering the extended warranty decides on the terms of the policy in its best interest and incurs the repair costs of product failures. We use game theoretic models to answer the following questions. Which scenario leads to a higher supply-chain profit, the retailer offering the extended warranty or the manufacturer? How do the optimum price and extended warranty length vary under different scenarios? We find that, depending on the parameters, either party may provide better extended warranty policies and generate more system profit. We also compare these two decentralized models with a centralized system where a single party manufactures the product, sells it to the consumer, and offers the extended warranty. We also consider an extension of our basic model where either the manufacturer or the retailer resells the extended warranty policies of a third party (e.g., an independent insurance company), instead of offering its own policy.

AB  - `Critical infrastructure' generally refers to significant pieces of plant and equipment, such as power stations and motorways. High population densities in cities, and the increasing interconnectedness of the services and supply chains that sustain them, mean local infrastructure is equally important. Local infrastructure must be able to cope with system shocks, whether from natural hazards, terrorism or catastrophic failures. Engineering design plays a major part in achieving this, but shocks will occur that overwhelm even the most conservative design. Local infrastructure must therefore be able to adapt to, and recover from, shocks: it must be resilient. Local infrastructure has evolved with little consideration for resilience of the interconnected system as a whole, whereas resilience has been the subject of much research in many other systems. This paper explores the lessons that local infrastructure can learn from such research by reviewing literature related to resilience of ecological, economic, physical infrastructure, community/social and government systems. A critical analysis highlights the factors affecting resilience and different approaches that need to be taken into account when attempting to model infrastructure at a local scale. The ultimate aim is to provide an evidence base on which to build resilience into various infrastructures and direct future local infrastructure resilience research in an age of austerity.

AU  - Jones, Rick A.
AU  - Horowitz, Barry
T2  - SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - As exemplified in the 2010 Stuxnet attack on an Iranian nuclear facility, attackers have the capabilities to embed infections in equipment that is employed in nuclear power systems. In this paper, a new systems engineering focused approach for mitigating such risks is described. This approach involves the development of a security architectural formulation that integrates a set of reusable security services as an architectural solution that is an embedded component of the system to be protected. The System-Aware architectural approach embeds security components into the system to be protected. The architecture includes services that (1) collect and assess real-time security relevant measurements from the system being protected, (2) perform security analysis on those measurements, and (3) execute system security control actions as required. This architectural formulation results in a defense that is referred to as System-Aware Cyber Security. This includes (1) the integration of a diverse set of dynamically interchangeable redundant subsystems involving hardware and software components provided from multiple vendors to significantly increase the difficulty for adversaries by avoiding a monoculture environment, (2) the development of subsystems that are capable of rapidly changing their attack surface through hardware and software reconfiguration (configuration hopping) in response to perceived threats, (3) data consistency checking services (e.g., intelligent voting mechanisms) for isolating faults and permitting moving surface control actions to avoid operations in a compromised configuration, and (4) forensic analysis techniques for rapid post-attack categorization of whether a given fault is more likely the result of an infected embedded hardware or software component (i.e., cyber attack) or a natural failure. In this paper we present these key elements of the System-Aware Cyber Security architecture and show, including an application example, how they can be integrated to mitigate the risks of insider and supply chain attacks. In addition, this paper outlines an initial vision for a security analysis framework to compare alternative System-Aware security architectures. Finally, we summarize future research that is necessary to facilitate implementation across additional domains critical to the nation's interest. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng

AU  - Kim, Hahnsang

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Conventional battery management systems (BMSs) for electric vehicles (EVs) are designed in an ad hoc way, causing the supply of EVs to fall behind the market demand. A well-designed and combined hardware-software architecture is essential for the efficient management of a large-scale battery pack that may consists of thousands of battery cells as in Tesla Motors and GM Chevy Volt. We propose a Dependable, Efficient, Scalable Architecture (DESA) that effectively monitors a large number of battery cells, efficiently controls, and reconfigures, if needed, their connection arrangement. DESA supports hierarchical, autonomous management of battery cells, where a global BMS orchestrates a group of local BMSs. A local controller on each local BMS autonomously manages an array of battery cells, and the global controller reconfigures the connectivity of such battery-cell arrays in coordination with the local controllers. Also, DESA allows individual arrays and local BMSs to be selectively powered-off for energy savings. The performance of this energy-saving capability is modeled and evaluated using a Markov chain. Our evaluation results show that DESA effectively tolerates battery-cell failures by an order-of-magnitude-while achieving 7.4 x service cost savings-better than a conventional BMS. This superior performance not only extends the battery life significantly, but also provides the flexibility in supporting diverse electric power demands from a growing number of on-board applications.

TI  - An Analytical Performance Modeling Approach for Supply Chain Networks
AU  - Srivathsan, Sandeep
AU  - Kamath, Manjunath
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - An analytical performance modeling approach for supply chain networks (SCNs) is developed based on the parametric decomposition method. The upstream flow of demand information and the downstream flow of material are analyzed to derive the arrival process parameters at various inventory points in a SCN. A sequential solution procedure that proceeds from the supplier stage to the retailer stage is then developed. The backorder distribution plays a key role in linking probability calculations between adjacent stages in the SCN model. This sequential procedure can be used to derive the inventory and backorder distributions at various inventory points in the SCN, when specific models are chosen for the SCN components, namely, suppliers, transportation operations, and manufacturers. An example SCN with three suppliers, two manufacturers, and three retailers is used to illustrate the modeling approach. The accuracy of the analytical results is evaluated by comparison with simulation estimates. The approach developed yields computationally efficient and numerically accurate analytical models that are especially useful in addressing SCN design issues. Note to Practitioners-Inventory management plays an important role in the overall performance of SCNs. As higher inventory levels lead to higher holding costs, companies in a SCN focus on reducing inventory levels. However, in today's competitive, customer-driven market, companies have to ensure that the customer orders are satisfied immediately or at the earliest. Any failure in doing so could result in loss of goodwill and market share. Therefore, a company has to tradeoff between the amount of inventory to be held and a desired service level. This has necessitated the development of a richer set of performance evaluation tools to aid in SCN design. This paper presents the development of a robust and generic approach for the aggregate level performance evaluation of SCNs. The model can evaluate the SCN performance given maximum inventory levels, production capacities, transit delays, and variability in processing times and (demand) arrival processes. The model developed can be coupled with an optimization model or used in a “what-if” mode to support key tactical design decisions related to target inventory levels of raw material, intermediate goods, and finished goods as well as production capacities.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - Performance based contracting (PBC) emerges as a new after-sales service practice to support the operation and maintenance of capital equipment or systems. Under the PBC framework, the goal of the study is to increase the system operational availability while minimizing the logistics footprint through the design for reliability. We consider the situation where the number of installed systems randomly increases over the planning horizon, resulting in a non-stationary maintenance and repair demand. Renewal equation and Poisson process are used to estimate the aggregate fleet failures. We propose a dynamic stocking policy that adaptively replenishes the inventory to meet the time-varying parts demand. An optimization model is formulated and solved under a multi-phase adaptive inventory control policy. The study provides theoretical insights into the performance-driven service operation in the context of changing system fleet size due to new installations. Trade-offs between reliability design and inventory level are examined and compared in various shipment scenarios. Numerical examples drawn from semiconductor equipment industry are used to demonstrate the applicability and the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB  - The primary goal of this study is to investigate the roles of expectations and purchase criticality on consumers' brand perceptions and attribution behaviors in service delivery failures. The provision of logistics services is often a crucial point in supply chain management that can influence brand perceptions of customers. Indeed, the level and the quality of customer service provided may determine whether the organization will retain existing customers or even attract new ones. As a consequence, a failure in logistics customer service and its effect on overall perceptions of a brand should not be underestimated. Furthermore, the involvement of a third-party logistics (3PL) company in this failure situation can create considerable shifts in the responses of consumers, especially in the attribution behavior for cause of failure. By applying scenario-based experiments, this study demonstrates the dynamics by which customer expectations, purchase criticality and 3PL companies affect consumer brand perceptions and attributions. The results suggest the presence of two expectation-based buffering effects in delivery failures. The first buffering effect is revealed in overall brand evaluation and repurchase intention, while the second buffering effect is observed in consumer brand attribution. The findings indicate that higher expectations may protect the brand and cause more attribution to the third-party service provider. Additionally, it is shown that criticality of the purchase has crucial impacts on brand evaluations and attributions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB  - Today, manufacturing operates as a global network, which has created more awareness of the quality of products and services. A systematic and rational way of managing quality assurance is currently lacking. This can cause serious problems in sectors such as the medical industry, as product failure may not only cause time delays, but also create risks for the health and safety of patients and users. This paper proposes a quality assurance approach that incorporates risk analysis (based on ISO14971) and failure analysis (based on FMEA) into the product design phase to assure product quality in the short term and facilitate global manufacturing practices in the long run. The proposed approach includes a Markov model to predict product failure from a customer perspective, which serves as a checkpoint for feedback to provide a basis for quality assurance. A medical equipment firm is used as a test-bed to illustrate how the proposed approach works and to verify its effectiveness.

AB  - Biotechnology is founded upon an ever-increasing understanding of the mechanisms that maintains living organisms and allows them to reproduce from generation to generation. We are living in an age of biotechnology, which is developing rapidly to expand further in the next few decades. It is a modern science that deals with the biological process through which technological innovation can be achieved and subjected to deliver goods and services for the benefit of human being. This “august” journey, which started with the production of insulin by the bacteria E. Coli, experienced a phenomenal growth since than. Reproductive biotechnologies include, semen processing, cryo-preservation, vitrification, sexing of sperm and embryos, artificial insemination, embryo transfer, in vitro fertilization, cloning, transgensis, juvenile in vitro embryo transfer, chimera production, multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, aspiration of oocytes from the live animals and zygote intra-fallopian tube transfer. In Pakistan these modern technologies have yet to play their due role in different areas especially in the fields of agriculture, medicine, dairy industry and environment. In the present post-flood scenario, the dairy supply chain recognized the need to work together in order to address this significant challenge. Especially in Pakistan, this future intra-disciplinary cooperation will also be needed among the industries, consumers and research institutes. Failure to achieve a high level of cooperation can potentially lead to a delay in reproductive biotechnologies application in development and will result in serious long lasting economic losses. This review is an attempt to analyze the current situation of the reproductive biotechnologies in dairy industry in the country and propose means for research and development interventions in the dairy sector through coordinated efforts of academia, government departments, development agencies and private sector organizations to achieve the highest possible benefits.

Despite the prioritisation of TB, HIV and STI programmes in South Africa, service targets are not achieved have had little effect, and the magnitude of the epidemics continues to escalate. Objective. To report on a participatory quality improvement intervention designed to evaluate these priority programmes in primary health care (PHC) clinics a rural district in KwaZulr-Natal. Methods. A participatory quality improvement intervention with district health managers, PHC supervisors and researchers was used to modify a TB/HIV/STI audit tool for use in a rural area, conduct a district wide clinic audit assess performance, set targets and develop plans to address the problems identified. Results. We highlight weaknesses in training and support of staff at PHC clinics, pharmaceutical and laboratory failures, inadequate monitoring of patients as contributing to poor TB, HIV and STI service implementation. In the 25 facilities audited, 71% of the clinical - staff had received no training in TB diagnosis and management, and 46% of the facilities were visited monthly by a, PHC supervisor. Eighty per cent of the facilities experienced non-availability of essential drugs and supplies; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results were not documented for 54% of specimens assessed, and the mean length of time between eligibility for ART and starting treatment was 47 days. Conclusion. Through a participatory approach, a TB/HIV/STI audit tool was successfully adapted and implemented in a rural district. It yielded information enabling managers to identify obstacles to TB, HIV and STI service implementation and develop Plans to address these. The audit can be used by the district to monitor priority services at,a primary level.. S Afr Med J 2011;101:887-890.

AB  - This study investigates operations failures in online retailing. Specifically, it examines the relationship between an operations glitch (order fulfillment delay) and subsequent shopping behavior for previously loyal customers in an online retailing environment. Using archival data from a moderate-sized online retailer of printed material, this study employs expectancy disconfirmation and distributive justice theories to empirically show that adverse post-glitch reactions are seen in several dimensions of customer shopping behavior - order frequency and order size decrease, while customer anxiety level increases. The study thus demonstrates that online retailers need to deliver on order fulfillment promises, since a failure to live up to these promises can be detrimental. This study is unique in that, unlike previous studies on order fulfillment in online retailing investigating the tie between fulfillment success and future behavior, we examine the repercussions of order fulfillment failures upon future purchase behavior.

AB  - Over the last decade, increased funding to support HIV treatment programs has enabled millions of new patients in developing countries to access the medications they need. Today, although demand for antiretrovirals continues to grow, the financial crisis has severely constrained funding leaving countries with difficult choices on program prioritization. Product optimization is one solution countries can pursue to continue to improve patient care while also uncovering savings that can be used for further scale up or other health system needs. Program managers can make procurement decisions that actually reduce program costs by considering additional factors beyond World Health Organization guidelines when making procurement decisions. These include in-country product availability, convenience, price, and logistics such as supply chain implications and laboratory testing requirements. Three immediate product selection opportunities in the HIV space include using boosted atazanavir in place of lopinovir for second-line therapy, lamivudine instead of emtricitabine in both first-line and second-line therapy, and tenofovir + lamivudine over abacavir + didanosine in second-line therapy. If these 3 opportunities were broadly implemented in sub-Saharan Africa and India today, approximately $300 million of savings would be realized over the next 5 years, enabling hundreds of thousands of additional patients to be treated. Although the discussion herein is specific to antriretrovirals, the principles of product selection are generalizable to diseases with multiple treatment options and fungible commodity procurement. Identifying and implementing approaches to overcome health system inefficiencies will help sustain and may expand quality care in resource-limited settings.

AB  - The formation of integrated logistics supply chain within the energy sector needs an effective information management within the framework of energy companies and between different actors (the extended enterprises). It is necessary to centralize main processes such as customer service and the introduction and storage of large amounts of data in different fields of the business. The above statements document the need for a more integrated strategy for action across all processes for energy companies, particularly in the area of issues related to implementation processes, changes in the organization. The article emphasizes the importance of the task and the effects of an effective system of training, particularly: the elimination of uncertainty, resulting from a lack of reliable information about the changes that may be a real threat to the whole process of organization change.

T2  - DECISION SCIENCES
AB  - Internet start-ups and traditional firms expanding existing offerings and services through the Net have seen both success and failure. For such business model pursuits, electronic intermediation possesses the ability to cultivate new marketplaces and restructure supply chains. The economic literature identifies four distinct intermediary roles, specifically: (i) information and (ii) logistics management, (iii) transaction securitization, as well as (iv) insurance/market-making and liquidity management. Research notes that electronic intermediaries, while possessing clear advantages in their ability to manage information, face greater challenges in allowing parties to benefit from the facilitation of more complex coordination activities, namely transaction securitization in addition to insurance/market-making and liquidity management. In an effort to better understand pursuit of functional intermediary roles, our analysis of data collected on 182 electronic intermediaries explores relationships between intermediation roles and profitability. Business models relying solely upon the provision of information management are likely to realize lower levels of profitability. Alternately, the intermediary roles of logistics management as well as insurance/market-making and liquidity management realize higher levels of profitability. Moreover, when comparing commodity- and service-based intermediaries, the provision of logistics management on the part of commodity-based firms sees higher levels of profitability, with insurance and liquidity provisions associated with greater profitability for both commodity- and service-based firms. Finally, when contrasting traditional firms expanding operations in digital markets with Internet pure-plays, we find transaction securitization functions increase the likelihood of realizing greater profitability for non-Internet pure-plays.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Internet retailing offers merchants limitless shelf space. This has led experts to highlight the existence of a “long tail” of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is “selling less of more.” However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size.

AB  - This paper attempts to evaluate the impact of risk factors from the container security initiative (CSI) on the maritime supply chain in Taiwan, employs a loss exposure matrix to identify the severity and frequency of security risk, and uses a bowtie diagram to investigate appropriate risk management strategies to deal with maritime security risks. This paper's findings consist of the following: (1) the leading categories of CSI risk factors are operational risk, physical risk and financial risk; (2) apart from two security risks comprising high-risk level, the majority of risk exposure is at the medium level; risk management strategies include loss prevention, loss reduction, avoidance, and non-insurance transfer; and (3) all maritime security regulations and measures should consider the balance among cost, time, security, efficiency and competition; failure to do so may lead to additional burdens for maritime supply chain service providers.

T2  - FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
AB  - A robust supply chain is critical to ensure a sustainable supply of feedstock to the existing and emerging bioenergy and bioproducts industries. Logging contractors are a key group in this process, since they provide harvesting and transportation services, and their success is directly linked to innovation activities. Surprisingly, very little is known about the innovation system in the logging industry-especially about how it relates to biomass supply. Failure to understand how logging contractors adopt and implement biomass production technologies could lead to failed innovation efforts, unmet development goals, and a lack of properly equipped contractors. This article presents results from a series of case studies of highly innovative logging contractors in Maine. All of the firms had some experience producing biomass within their operations. The firms had also used multiple biomass harvesting technologies. This study highlights the variation in challenges that led to the adoption (or rejection) of biomass as a product innovation with particular emphasis on harvesting technologies. A major finding of this study was the need for a high degree of collaboration between landowners, logging contractors, and biomass consuming facilities in the innovation process. The future development of the biomass industry is highly dependent on contractors adopting biomass harvesting and related technologies. The innovation process of logging firms is an area that is not sufficiently studied, and this research provides valuable insight into this important component of the forest biomass industry.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION
AB  - Despite substantial investments in public health and clinical research at the national level, and significant advancements in these areas of science, few evidence-based programs and services are rapidly implemented in health care or public health practice as a result of failures of dissemination. A significant gap in current processes to disseminate and implement effective programs relates to the lack of systems and infrastructure to facilitate distribution of scientific research products to potential end users, including clinicians and other practitioners. In this article, the authors assert that Web 2.0 technologies can be leveraged to enhance dissemination efforts and increase the implementation of evidence-based programs and services in everyday practice. The authors describe the research-to-practice delivery process and highlight gaps in the supply chain necessary to translate research findings into evidence-based practice. The authors critically evaluate the 4 most prominent strategies currently used to promote dissemination and implementation of research evidence in practice, and they detail how each can be improved by leveraging Web 2.0 technologies to enhance dissemination of research evidence. Last, the authors provide examples and suggestions for capitalizing on Web 2.0 technologies to enhance dissemination efforts and ensure that evidence-based research products reach intended end users and are implemented in clinical practice.

TI  - Planting the Living City Best Practices in Planning Green Infrastructure-Results From Major U.S. Cities
AU  - Young, Robert F.
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
AB  - Problem: Critics have problematized infrastructure for its inability to keep pace with the rising social and ecological impacts of urbanization. Researchers identify urban green infrastructure (GI), including urban forests, as an important strategy for providing public goods and increasing resiliency while reducing ecological footprints and social inequity in metropolitan areas; however, realizing these benefits through planning is still uncertain ground, as most contemporary urban GI endeavors in the United States are small, individual projects rather than integrated, community-wide efforts. This underinvestment has left planners with little experience in developing GI at a metropolitan scale. Purpose: We address this deficit in infrastructure planning by studying planning's role in advancing large-scale, urban tree-planting initiatives (TPI) in eight major U. S. cities and one metropolitan county. In this study, we explore stakeholder perspectives on successes and setbacks in TPI planting, stewardship, business, and out-reach plans. From these perspectives, we identify possible best practices that can better inform future efforts to plan GI on a metropolitan scale. Methods: From a review of the literature, we identified ideal planning elements researchers and practitioners considered fundamental to well-planned, urban forestry-based GI programs. We interviewed key stakeholders (n = 86) in eight major cities and one metropolitan county (New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Baltimore, Seattle, Denver, Albuquerque, Sacramento, and Salt Lake County), using multiple-choice and open-ended questions to explore their perceptions of TPI successes, failures, and opportunities for improvement. We used this data to compare TPI planning and implementation with ideal urban forestry and GI planning elements, to identify TPI best practices, and to locate TPI program elements such as business and stewardship planning in relation to traditional infrastructure. We discuss these findings in light of opportunities to bring GI into the mainstream of metropolitan infrastructure planning. Results and conclusions: We found that cities employed a spectrum of planning strategies to advance TPI, ranging from highly institutionalized, data-driven initiatives to decentralized, grassroots efforts. Participants viewed TPI as bringing GI to the mainstream; however, uncertainties in funding and long-term stewardship belie this perspective. Lacking access to traditional infrastructure financing, several TPI used creative development and contracting strategies to maintain program funding and momentum, while others stagnated. Additionally, programs lost momentum when mayors who launched TPI were not reelected. Successful underfunded initiatives focused on community-level engagement. However, institutionalized, diverse funding structures and robust, agency-level commitment to maintaining and expanding urban forests were considered most effective in advancing urban forestry-based GI. Overall geographic distribution of TPI, and the relatively sophisticated financial and institutional approaches achieved by New York and Seattle, provide insight into possible national strategies to advance metropolitan-scale GI. Similarly, Los Angeles's and Baltimore's use of focused corporate sponsorship and community engagement to advance underfunded programs could inform international GI efforts. Takeaway for practice: Through large-scale TPI, planners are beginning to engage in planning metropolitan-scale GI as a conscious strategy to address urban ecological issues and deliver public goods. Initiatives benefit from being launched early in an administration's term. Further, detailed, data-driven planting plans, combined with diversified funding sources and the institutionalization of tree-acquisition in the capital budget, can enable TPI to establish a) long-term contracts, b) control over supply chains, and c) stability in recessionary times. Contracting with grassroots and advocacy organizations to perform education and fieldwork can provide means for underfunded programs to maintain momentum toward meeting TPI goals; however, accessing traditional infrastructure financing mechanisms and institutionalizing stewardship plans are fundamental to long-term expansion and maintenance of investments in metropolitan GI.

AB  - Objective. To assess the consequences of private outsourcing on the overall supply and filling of prescriptions in state health services. Material and Methods. The research was conducted using quantitative and qualitative techniques in 13 states. The information was collected through interviews and direct observation. The interviews were carried on staff of state health services related to the drug supply chain and users of health services. The quantitative approach examined the percentage of stocked full recipes in a sample of users. Results. States that have opted for the fully outsourced model, and properly monitored this choice, have increased the supply of drugs to their users and guaranteed the supply in the care units in charge. Other states with the outsourced model have multiple problems: direct purchase of drugs not included in the basic drugs catalogue, failure of suppliers and shortage of supplies in the laboratories that provide the company. The main disadvantages identified in all models were: the subordination of the medical criteria to administrative criteria, insufficient planning based on local care needs, heterogeneous procedures, insufficient knowledge of regulations and lack of normativity. Conclusion. The results indicate that the incorporation of private providers in the drug supply chain may not be the solution to bring down the shortage faced by health services, especially at the hospital level. The shift to outsourcing models has developed without incorporating Evaluation mechanisms and the consequences that this transition can have on state health systems must be investigated more deeply.

T2  - SERVICES PARTS MANAGEMENT: DEMAND FORECASTING AND INVENTORY CONTROL
A2  - Altay, N and Litteral, LA
AB  - Throughout this book several characteristics and approaches are presented for dealing with the unique challenges of service parts management. While there are some organizations who apply rigorous and innovative methods, service parts management is an area where practice often lags theory. This chapter presents some of the common misperceptions and failures that often occur in the management of service parts supply chains in the high technology, aviation, automotive and telecom industries. The good news for managers of service parts supply chains is that opportunities for improvement abound. Readers of this book can evaluate the performance of any parts supply network and compare the methods actually used to each method described in this book. This can be done by asking a few simple questions relative to each technique: Does the problem this technique addresses exist in this service environment? Often the answer will be yes! How does this organization currently deal with this problem? Is the method described in this book appropriate for this environment? Are there other methods that would lead to an improvement in this area? Through an analysis beginning with the simple questions listed above, consultants and managers can discover guidelines for improvement that can serve as the foundation for a short, medium and long term plan for transformation of the service supply chain. Due to the common mistakes fueled by misperception, the opportunity for improvement is often dramatic.

TI  - WTO Subsidies Discipline During and after the Crisis
AU  - Horlick, Gary N.
AU  - Clarke, Peggy A.
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
AB  - This article reviews the successes of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (the strengthened discipline on export subsidies), and the failures (the lack of discipline on domestic subsidies) from the birth of the WTO in 1995 to the onset of the financial crisis in 2007-09. During the crisis, governments poured money into economically necessary or politically deserving industries. The prohibition on export subsidies held up fairly well during the crisis, but the prohibition on import-substitution subsidies was likely flouted by understandings that bail-outs of industrial companies would lead to use of local supply chains. Trillions of dollars were poured into service sectors, notably financial services and real estate, and there are no WTO rules for services subsidies, notwithstanding commitments to negotiate them in the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Most likely, if there had been any rules disciplining subsidies in the financial services sectors, they would have been ignored, as the disciplines on domestic subsidies for goods were often ignored during the crisis, and before it. The crisis threw into clearer relief the question of why governments agreed to rules in 1994 which they found too uncomfortable to obey, or to enforce against other governments. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures sets up rules which are not strict enough to eliminate the use of countervailing duties as protectionism, and disciplines on subsidies that are too loose to prevent politicians from over-subsidizing. The authors conclude with some thoughts on the future of subsidies disciplines within the WTO.

TI  - Private goods and services contracts: Increased emergency response capacity or increased vulnerability?
AU  - Egan, M. Jude
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB  - The United States public sector increasingly contracts with and relies on private firms to provide public goods. While this has brought efficiency gains in many contexts, in the disaster response context, these gains may be offset by increasing vulnerability to the public emergency response system by making it subject to the fragility of lean supply chains. Public-private contracts rely on the private law enforcement regime, an analysis of which indicates that there may be disincentives for private contractors to perform contractual obligations as disasters disrupt efficient supply chains and increase the cost of performance. This article argues that increasing public sector reliance on private contractor performance under extreme stress and uncertainty increases the complexity and interdependence of component parts of the disaster response system, key predictors of system failure. This article addresses the challenge of relying on private firms to provide public goods during a disaster and suggests several possibilities to increase reliability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the preferred dialysis modality for many patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. However, in sharp contrast to the high rates of PD use in other industrialized countries, PD use in the United States is low and decreasing. PD availability is a necessary condition for PD use; however, little is known about the availability and geographic distribution of PD services. This study describes trends in the regional supply of PD services in dialysis facilities between 1995 and 2003. Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting & Participants: Nonfederal outpatient dialysis facilities treating patients with ESRD in the United States using data from the US Renal Data System. Predictors: Annual ESRD patient and dialysis facility composition in hospital referral regions. Outcome: Annual proportion of dialysis facilities offering PD treatment services in hospital referral regions. Results: The average proportion of facilities offering PD services in hospital referral regions was 56% in 1996, which decreased to 47% in 2003. There was geographic variation in PD services, with greater PD availability in metropolitan cities (compared with rural regions) and the Northeast (relative to the South and Midwest). Variation in PD availability was not explained by disease trends or patient characteristics believed to be important for PD use. An increasing regional presence of chain-affiliated facilities was associated with less PD supply. Limitations: Accuracy of patient registry data, inability to account for consolidation of PD services among chain providers, sensitivity of results to definition of regional markets. Conclusions: The small and decreasing availability of PD therapy seems counterintuitive given its demonstrated appeal to patients and payers. Further research is needed to investigate dialysis facilities' role in the underuse of a potentially useful therapy. Am J Kidney Dis 55: 1079-1087.

AU  - Mendes Primo, Marcos Andre
T2  - OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Suppliers are expected to reduce manufacturing firm supply risks by minimizing supply failures and by resolving supply problems, even those ones resulting from firm's actions. Integration mechanisms may enhance interaction and collaboration in the firm supply chain, especially in the buyer-supplier interface, to reach these goals. Based on case studies in four North-American manufacturing companies in the electronic and aerospace industries, we analyzed the importance of integration mechanisms for manufacturing firms to address supply problems. We also explored some drivers supporting those mechanisms. Supplier commitment was found to be a key integration factor to address supply problems. This may be accomplished by trust and power mechanisms. Internal integration between purchasing and manufacturing groups also played a significant role in supplier collaboration at the problem solving process. Customer integration seemed more important to address supply problems for contract manufacturers than for Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) firms. Although supply problems might originate several stages upstream in the supply chain, surprisingly there was no integration beyond direct suppliers in the manufacturing firm supply chain.

T2  - INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to enhance the responsiveness of enterprises with regard to delivery schedules in a supply chain. Based on the observations in industry, it seems that companies often re-negotiate their due-dates. These phenomena have begun to appear only recently, as a result of the advancements of information technology and flexibility in the supply chain. However, these due-date re-negotiation processes are haphazard and ad hoc in nature, and a formal process is needed to respond to market fluctuations more quickly. In this paper, a re-negotiable order processing method is developed that can change the already-assigned due-dates or allow partial shipments to increase the flexibility of firm response to a rush order from a prior customer (PC). Design/methodology/approach - A due-date re-negotiation process is defined and a formal system for handling customer orders is proposed. The new data and business process integration model are proposed for the due-date re-negotiation process based on RosettaNet's Partner Interface Processes. Web services and ubiquitous computing technologies are used in the proposed system architecture to allow for responive sales order management. Findings - The paper shows that assigned due-dates can also be re-negotiated by enhancing the connectivity and visibility of the supply chain with co-operative customers. In the early stage of the product life cycle or high-regional demand variation environments, it is better to re-negotiate due-dates than to meet scheduled due-dates. Practical implications - In some instances, meeting the due-date requested by a customer relates to the success or failure of a particular sales order. The proposed re-negotiation method could help the sales offices of the MF to respond to PC requests quickly and flexibly. Rush orders from PC might be acceptable based on the slack gained through the re-negotiation of co-operative customers' assigned orders. Originality/value - There has been a considerable volume of studies on the due-date assignment, order releasing, and scheduling problems. However, these previous studies considered due-dates as exogenous parameters or fixed endogenous variables. In this paper, the assigned due-dates for pre-contracted co-operative customers are considered as re-negotiable variables. On the other hand, most studies on ubiquitous computing technologies, especially those relate to radio frequency identification (RFID), have focused mostly on asset management and processing time reduction. This paper suggests other benefits of increased visibility and traceability of RFID technology in enhancing responsiveness and flexibility in the sales order management system.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB  - In this paper, the role of integrative supply management practices (ISMP) in enabling higher performance in an outsourcing relationship is examined. It is hypothesised that ISMP plays a mediating role between the motivation to outsource and the success of the outsourcing relationship. Given the paucity of literature in outsourcing pertaining to the role of practices on improving the performance of an outsourcing engagement, multiple case studies of buyers and suppliers from manufacturing and service sectors were used in this study. Using a grounded theory approach, the mediating role of ISMP on outsourcing performance is explicated. Two distinct supply management practice types are identified: failure-prevention practices and performance-enhancing practices. We find that the intensity of implementation of these practices is contingent on the motivations of the firms to outsource. In addition, these two practice types play a role in determining performance outcomes in an outsourcing relationship. We propose a detailed conceptual model based on the analysis of case study data, provide testable propositions and discuss implications for theory and practice.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - “Digitally connected enterprises” refers to e-business, global supply chains, and other new business designs of the Knowledge Economy; all of which require open and scalable information supply chains across independent enterprises. Connecting proprietarily designed and controlled enterprise databases in these information supply chains is a critical success factor for them. Previous connection designs tend to rely on “hard-coded” regimes, which do not respond well to disruptions (including changes and failures), and do not afford these enterprises sufficient flexibility to join simultaneously in multiple supply chain regimes and share information for the benefit of all. The paper develops a new design: It combines matchmaking with global database query, and thereby supports the interoperation of independent databases to form on-demand information supply chains. The design provides flexible (re) configuration to decrease the impact of disruption, and proactive control to increase collaboration and information sharing. More broadly, the papers results contribute to a new Information System design method for massively extended enterprises, and facilitate new business designs using digital connections at the level of databases.

TI  - Using Bayesian Networks to forecast spares demand from equipment failures in a changing service logistics context
AU  - Boutselis, Petros
AU  - McNaught, Ken
T2  - The Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on Inventories
AB  - A problem faced by some Logistic Support Organisations (LSOs) is that of forecasting the demand for spare parts, corresponding to equipment failures within the system. Here we are particularly concerned with a final phase of operations and the opportunity to place only a single order to cover demand during this phase. The problem is further complicated when the service logistics context can change during this final phase, e.g. as the number of systems supported or the LSO's resources change. Such a problem is typical of the final phase of many military operations. The LSO operates the recovery and repair loop for the equipment in question. By developing a simulation of the LSO, we can generate synthetic operational data regarding equipment breakdowns, etc. We then split that data into a training set and a test set in order to compare several approaches to forecasting demand in the final operational phase. We are particularly interested in the application of Bayesian network models for this type of forecasting since these offer a way of combining hard observational data with subjective expert opinion. Different LSO configurations were simulated to create a test dataset and the simulation results were compared with the various forecasts. The BN that learned from training data performed best, followed by a hybrid BN design combining expert elicitation and machine learning, and then a logistic regression model. An expert-adjusted exponential smoothing model was the poorest performer and these differences were statistically significant. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results, some implications for practice and suggestions for future work.

AB  - Business use of cloud computing services is motivated by ease of use and potential financial cost reductions. Service failure may occur when the service provider does not protect information or when the use of the services becomes overly complex and difficult. The benefits of cloud computing also bring optimization challenges for the information owners who must assess service security risks and the degree to which new human behaviors are required. In this research, we look at the risk of identity theft when ease of service access is provided through a single sign-on (SSO) authorization, asking: What are the optimal behavioral expectations for a cloud service information owner? Federated identity management provides well-developed design literature on strategies for optimizing human behaviors in relation to the new technologies. We briefly review the literature and then propose a working solution that optimizes the trade-off between disclosure risk, human user risk, and service security.

T2  - Reliability Engineering & System Safety
AB  - The continuous provision of highly available IT services is a crucial task for IT service providers in order to fulfill service level agreements with customers. Although the introduction of redundant components increases availability, the associated cost may be very high. Therefore, decision makers in the IT service design stage face a trade-off between cost and availability in order to define suitable service level objectives. Although this task can be seen as a redundancy allocation problem, the existing definitions in this area are not transferable to IT service design due to the assumption of independent component failures, which has been identified as unrealistic in IT systems. In this paper, a multi-objective redundancy allocation problem for IT service design is defined. Therefore, a Petri net Monte Carlo simulation is developed that estimates the availability and costs of a specific design. In order to provide (sub)optimal solutions to an IT service redundancy allocation problem, two meta-heuristics, namely a genetic algorithm and tabu search, are adapted. The approach is utilized to optimize the IT service design of an application service provider in terms of availability and cost to demonstrate its feasibility and suitability.

T2  - Computer Networks
AB  - Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures play a key role in the evolution from traditional power systems to Smart Grids. Increasingly fluctuating power flows, sparked by the transition towards sustainable energy generation, become a major issue for power grid stability. To deal with this challenge, future Smart Grids require precise monitoring and control, which in turn demand for reliable, real-time capable and cost-efficient communications. For this purpose, we propose applying Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to handle the manifold requirements of Smart Grid communications. To achieve reliability, our approach encompasses fast recovery after failures in the communication network and dynamic service-aware network (re-)configuration. Network Calculus (NC) logic is embedded into our SDN controller for meeting latency requirements imposed by the standard IEC 61850 of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Thus, routing provides delay-optimal paths under consideration of existing cross traffic. Also, continuous latency bound compliance is ensured by combining NC delay supervision with means of flexible reconfiguration. For evaluation we consider the well-known Nordic 32 test system, on which we map a corresponding communication network in both experiment and emulation. The described functionalities are validated, employing realistic IEC 61850 transmissions and distributed control traffic. Our results show that hard service guarantees can be ensured with the help of the proposed SDN solution. On this basis, we derive extremely time critical services, which must not be subjected to flexible reconfiguration.

AB  - The complex interactions between environmental and anthropogenic components have significantly influenced rice cultivation. The clear understanding of these interactions is important to (i) optimize rice provisioning ecosystem service (ES) supply, (ii) minimize negative impacts on other ES and (iii) choose suitable strategies for sustainable agriculture. Impacts of environmental and anthropogenic components on rice provisioning ES supply largely depend on site selection and farming practices. The demand for rice can be determined by the size of the population and imports/exports of rice products. Rice provisioning ES supply and demand need to be balanced if the goal is an import-independent and sustainable agriculture. As a decision support tool, Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) are used for quantifying various ES supply types, demands as well as their budgets. The BBN network presented in this study was developed through interviews, expert knowledge, geographical information systems and statistical models. The results show that the capacity of rice provision can be optimized through site selection and farming practice. The results can help to reduce crop failures and to choose suitable areas for the use of new practices and technologies. Moreover, the presented BBN has been used to forecast future patterns of rice provision through effective or ineffective options of the environmental and human-derived components in eight scenarios. Thereby, the BBN turns out to be a promising decision support tool for agricultural managers in predicting probabilities of success in scenarios of agricultural planning.

TI  - Static and dynamic adaptations for service-based systems
AU  - La, Hyun Jung
AU  - Kim, Soo Dong
T2  - Information and Software Technology
AB  - Context
In service-oriented computing (SOC), service providers publish reusable services, and service consumers subscribe them. However, there exist potential problems in reusing services. Mismatch is a problem that occurs when a candidate service does not fully match to the feature expected. Fault is a problem that occurs when an invocation of services results in some abnormality at runtime. Without remedying mismatch problems, services would not be reusable. Without remedying fault problems, service invocations at runtime would result in failures. Static and dynamic adaptations are practical approaches to remedying the problems.
Objective
Our objective is to define a comprehensive framework which includes a design of service adaptation framework (SAF), and design of static and dynamic adapters.
Method
We design the SAF which governs dynamic adaptations, and define a service life-cycle with adaptation-related activities. Based on causal–effect relationships among mismatch, fault, cause, and adapter, we derive mismatches and faults, from which their relevant causes are identified. For the causes, we define six static adapters and five dynamic adapters. We specify instructions for designing static adapters, and provide step-wise algorithms for designing dynamic adapters based on enterprise service bus (ESB). And, we show a proof-of-concept (POC) of implementation to show applicability of the methods.
Results
The paper presents service life-cycle with adaptation-related activities, SAF design, and design of static and dynamic adapters.
Conclusion
Mismatch and fault problems in utilizing services present threats to high reusability of services. Static adaptations can remedy mismatch problems, and dynamic adaptations can remedy fault problems. In this paper, we presented technical insights of service adaption, SAF design, and definitions of static and dynamic adapters. By utilizing the proposed SAF and service adapters, reusability of services can be greatly enhanced.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
Guyana is a small developing country with a high burden of cardiovascular disease and extensive barriers to optimal care delivery. We investigated the effectiveness of a newly established multidisciplinary inpatient cardiology service in this setting.
Methods
We performed an interrupted time-series cohort study of heart failure (HF) patients admitted to the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation from January to December 2015 and July 2016 to December 2017. The primary outcome was discharge on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Secondary outcomes included length of hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
Results
We identified 740 patients, 347 (46.9%) of whom were admitted after service implementation. The postimplementation cohort was more likely to be discharged on a beta-blocker (66.6% vs 41.7%; P < .01) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (31.7% vs 15.3%; P = .01). They were also more likely to undergo echocardiography (60.8% vs 40.5%; P < .01) and chest x-rays (70.6% vs 46.6%; P < .01). Hospitalization length (10.0 ± 13.1 vs 9.8 ± 10.1 days) and readmissions within 90 days (19.0% vs 19.1%) were not significantly different. There were fewer deaths in the postimplementation cohort compared with the preimplementation cohort (12/347 vs 28/393).
Conclusions
Establishment of a multidisciplinary inpatient cardiology service demonstrated increased adherence to GDMT without extending length of hospitalization.

AB  - Environmental externalities are a typical example of market failures. These market failures could be corrected if decision makers had the “right” information and were aware of the real costs of their activities. Currently, companies consider biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (ES) as environmental externalities. The idea proposed in this paper is to study the links between the life cycle of a product and ES. To achieve that, the paper presents an approach to account for ES in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This proposal is illustrated in an industrial case study by means of a bio economic model of ES.

AB  - When an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), which makes a final product for the consumer marketplace by purchasing components from its suppliers, faces unexpected supply network failures and market events, models of suppliers‟ manufacturing service capabilities can provide information required for efficient recovery of these supply network. Models of manufacturing service capabilities include descriptions of both material processing and manufacturing information processing capabilities of a supplier. Presently, manufacturers and suppliers are challenged in making and streamlining sourcing decisions due to limited, imprecise, or ambiguous semantics associated with these models. This paper identifies issues with existing manufacturing service capability (MSC) models by analyzing several practical use cases found in existing web portals containing supplier capability descriptions. We identify the use of an ontology-based manufacturing service capability model can address the imprecision and ambiguity issues. This paper also proposes an approach based on concept analyses on archetypal data sets as a way to enrich semantics and address the limited semantic issues. Several model extension methods for semantic enrichments are formalized within the approach. We demonstrate the approach on an ontology-based manufacturing service model called manufacturing service description language (MSDL) using data sets including product and service categories, detailed capability descriptions of specific processes, and product-term definitions.

AB  - Mechanical degradation of polymers reported so far, utilize cutting, impact or attrition for size reduction, which is very different from the low-magnitude forces experienced by the polymers during their service life. In this work, we have studied the effect of such low-magnitude forces, on the polymeric materials, using a low-energy rolling compression-type wet-grinder. The rolling compression action produces shear and compression on the polymer, leading to abrasion and resulting in the formation of crazes, micro-cracks and chip-offs, akin to the wearing. Measurements using Raman spectroscopy showed that the shear forces, generated upon grinding, produced strains on the polymer backbone, which upon sufficient build-up, results in chain scission at the points of physical entanglement. These homolytic chain scissions produced "mechano"radicals, which were confirmed by radical-scavenging using DPPH. The ensuing reduction in the molecular weight was further analyzed using GPC, light scattering and viscometry. Surprisingly, XRD measurements showed strain-induced crystallization as well. In order to theoretically validate the studies, a probabilistic model, explaining the "complex" response of the molecular weight distribution and the PDI upon mechanical degradation, has also been presented. Crosslink density function was incorporated to explain the preferential chain scission of the high molecular weight species, leading to a gradual reduction in the average molar mass.

TI  - Connecting demand and supply: The role of intermediation in public procurement of innovation
AU  - Edler, Jakob
AU  - Yeow, Jillian
T2  - Research Policy
AB  - Intermediation in innovation serves to establish or improve the link between different actors with complementary skill sets or interests in order to support the generation and diffusion of innovation. This article conceptualises and analyses intermediation between supply and demand using the example of public procurement of innovation. It defines specific intermediation needs and functions in different procurement situations and outlines the pre-condition for effective intermediation. The paper combines and contributes to the growing literature on innovation intermediation and public procurement of innovation. As the paper looks at the demand for innovation it adopts a broad understanding of innovation, defined as a product, service or process that is novel to the buying organisation. In order to develop the conceptualisation of intermediation in the process of demanding innovation, it builds on the existing, rather rudimentary conceptualisation of intermediation in the innovation and management literature. It presents an in-depth analysis of two very different procurement processes in two cases in a complex public sector setting, the English NHS, case of a public buying organisation triggering the generation of an innovation, and another in which an organisation sought to respond to an innovation offered in the marketplace. In both cases, the solution bought necessitated strong adaptation processes with considerable learning costs within the buying organisation. The paper shows how intelligent and tailored intermediation can tackle some of the well-known procedural and capability failures in the process of public procurement of innovation. In terms of policy implications, the article makes the claim for an increased effort to build up effective intermediation across procurement systems to support agencies in concrete procurement and, in doing so, to build up capacity for more intelligent public buying. While the focus on intermediation responds to an existing gap in the literature on public procurement of innovation, the paper has implication for demand-supply intermediation more generally.

A total of 278 USA consumer panel members completed the survey, and a structural equation modelling approach was used to analyse associations among constructs. Results suggest that incident familiarity before exposure to the YouTube apology, involvement with the apology, perceived persuasiveness of the apology, and attitude towards the CEO after the apology are all significantly associated with satisfaction with the company after the apology. This study provides timely and essential insights regarding the effects of a CEO YouTube service failure apology on customer satisfaction, and highlights many interesting future research directions.

T2  - The Asian Journal of Shipping and Logistics
AB  - ABSTRACT
Ports play a critical role in the economy of many countries and regions. Failure or unreliability of port services can significantly influence port customers—shipping lines and cargo owners—and result in their dissatisfaction. However, what constitutes port service quality (PSQ) and its influence on the satisfaction of port customers has not been well investigated in the literature. Therefore, this study investigates the concept of PSQ and its influence on customer satisfaction in the case of Korean container ports. Following a literature review, a conceptual model of PSQ and its influence on customer satisfaction is proposed. The model was validated through a survey of 313 members of the Korean Port Logistics Association (KPLA). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was conducted to confirm the PSQ dimensions and to examine their relationship with customer satisfaction using SmartPLS 3.2.1 software. PSQ is found to be a five-factor construct, and its management, and image and social responsibility factors have significant positive effects on customer satisfaction. In addition to its academic contribution, this study also contributes to management practices because port managers can use the PSQ scale to measure their customers’ satisfaction and justify investments in the quality management of port services.

AB  - Objectives
To evaluate community pharmacists’ reimbursed prescribing interventions (called pharmaceutical opinions/POs in Canada) by determining the types of drug-related problems (DRPs) identified; the type, quality, and clinical impact of recommendations made; and variation in recommendation quality across regions, pharmacy ownership type, and pharmacy size.
Design
Retrospective audit of randomly sampled service documentation records.
Setting
Community pharmacies in Ontario, Canada, 3 years after implementation of a government program that reimburses pharmacies for providing DRP-based POs to physicians.
Participants
Thirty-six community pharmacies in 4 regions of Ontario.
Main outcome measures
For each PO, 2 experienced clinical pharmacists independently, and then by consensus, determined the primary drug implicated and its therapeutic category, the type of DRP, and the type of prescriber recommendation. Each PO recommendation was assessed for clinical impact, evidence base, and overall quality. Chi-square analyses assessed the relationship between PO quality and pharmacy characteristics.
Results
Of 563 POs, 261 (46%) met reimbursement criteria for stating a DRP and prescriber recommendation. Among these eligible POs, systemic antiinfective (22%), alimentary tract and metabolism (19%), nervous system (15%), and cardiovascular (15%) drugs were most commonly identified in the DRP. Adverse drug reactions (which included drug interactions) were the most common type of DRP (42.5%), followed by “dose too high” (16%) and “needs additional therapy” (14%). Top recommendations were to change the drug (41%) and to decrease the dose (20%). The quality of the pharmacist’s recommendation was judged to be good to excellent in 70% of the 261 eligible POs; quality was associated with region and ownership type.
Conclusion
PO quality was suboptimal: the primary issue was failure to state a prescriber recommendation. Collaborative efforts are needed from community pharmacy stakeholders (schools of pharmacy, regulatory colleges, and continuing education providers) to help pharmacists enhance the quality of their POs, beginning with their clinical documentation skills.

AB  - The issues of elderly consumers remain under researched despite a rapidly aging population in most countries across the globe. We examine the service failure and complexity of problems of a nursing home for seniors and seek to contribute to the field of research in terms of exploring internal marketing solutions based on two theoretical frameworks- Service Profit Chain and the Relational Third Place theory. We aim to provide insights about why elderly people are not treated as consumers. Besides, based on comprehensive review of literature and analysis of an important case situation, we develop a new framework called Complex Organizational Problems and Solutions (COPS) by generalizing the insights we gained through the study. We find that internal marketing practices help improve employee satisfaction and service quality, which in turn leads to satisfied consumers.

AU  - Feng, Wei

T2  - Future Generation Computer Systems
AB  - Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) is an effective and novel method of data collection and processing. Current MCS generally adopts a centralized architecture by depending on an assumed trusted party. This design easily suffers from single-point failure and cannot be realized in practice since a trusted service provider does not really exist. More dangerously, the centralized party may perform dishonestly and thus harms the benefit and privacy of MCS users. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based MCS system, named MCS-Chain, to realize fully distributed and decentralized trust management in MCS. Aiming at improving the poor efficiency of traditional blockchain technology, we propose a novel consensus mechanism for block generation, which greatly reduces computational overhead. The proposed MCS-Chain system also solves the fork issue and centralization problem suffered by most existing blockchain-based systems. Serious security analysis and experimental evaluation further illustrate the security and efficiency of our system.

T2  - Product-Service Systems across Life Cycle
AB  - Manufacturing companies are increasingly becoming aware that the sale of a product does not end when the good is delivered to the customer. On the contrary, the product must be followed by the company throughout its life cycle; from its conception to its disposal. An increasingly common practice is to support the entire chain of sales and after sales, from dealers to end customers, with a range of services that give the product added value. For example in the field of crane manufacturers for trucks, Fassi Gru S.p.a. provides, in addition to its product training for the use and maintenance of cranes, tools for the simulation of the lifting capacity of the crane (Fassi Installation Program), monitoring of usage statistics and the state of wear of the crane (Fassi SmartApp, Internet of CraneTM), control of residual life, and the status and timing of maintenance (Maintenance Assistant). The work presented here is a new after sale service designed to identify quickly and easily the element that caused the failure of the crane through a series of guided questions about the behavior of the crane subject to malfunctions. This tool is called FIT (Fault Investigator Tool) and allows the network service Fassi rapid and accurate diagnosis of the cause of failure in case of malfunctions of the crane; reducing the time to diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary and costly replacement components by trial and error. The novelty of this work lies in the method used to achieve it; FIT was in fact created by the special knowledge gained from R&D engineers of Fassi about new methods of systematic innovation developed by the University of Bergamo. In this article some of these techniques are shown: in particular those dealing with the correct formulation of the problem, the functional analysis and the Anticipatory Failure Determination; a particular instrument that combines FMEA (Failure modes and effects analysis) and TRIZ (Theory of inventive problem solving). The article will also present the needs that led to the development of the tool and show the operation of the instrument through a case study; showing all the advantages provided by its application.

T2  - Telecommunications Policy
AB  - This paper aims at discussing the entry process and competitive strategies of MVNOs in Italy and France. It illustrates the features of competition in a sector – the mobile telecom service industry – which is characterized by market saturation and demand heterogeneity. In doing so, it looks at the characteristics of the two countries in terms of competition and entry of new operators, at the motivations behind the entry of MVNOs, and at the performance of different companies. Results show that the most successful MVNOs are those characterized by the ability to find a perfect match between their core competencies (large network management, strong brand reputation) and the needs of specific segments of demand that had not been previously fulfilled. In this context, companies with ICT network management skills, whether coming from the telecom sector or from other network-based service industries such as postal operators, have been particularly successful in the market. From a policy perspective, despite the failure of some MVNOs, customers have benefited from the increased competition between MNOs and MVNOs in terms of range of service offerings and prices.

AB  - The study examines the online public response to a high visibility incident of service failure from the crisis communication and image restoration perspectives. A specific incident in a hotel of a popular chain in Beijing, China, which was widely publicized on Chinese social network Weibo, is used as an example. Applying data mining and GIS to the collected data, the study analyzes temporal, spatial, topical, and gender dynamics of public discussions to investigate the usefulness of such data for hospitality providers in crisis. The study finds evidence that the effect of the incident on the general public is moderated by spatial and personal proximity of Weibo users. The discussion topics reflect the nature of the crisis and are affected by communications from the service provider and third parties. Implications for providers of tourism and hospitality services in a crisis of high visibility are discussed.

AB  - The provision of basic services suffers from a multitude of sustainability challenges in many cities of low-income countries. Sanitation provision faces particular challenges in the form of environmental contamination, high costs, and large inequalities among urban residents. In recent years an increasing number of innovations in on-site systems have been developed, which have not yet evolved into fully functional alternatives to the existing regimes. We study three prominent recent on-site sanitation initiatives in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya that aimed at developing entire “sanitation value chains”, which we conceptualize as an emerging Technological Innovation System (TIS). The analysis leads us to propose alternative governance modes for the TIS to overcome system failures such as capability, coordination and institutional barriers. Conceptually, the paper extends conventional TIS analyses towards entire value chains, enabling a wide range of transition processes to be addressed beyond informal settlements and low-income countries.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Distributed energy resource technologies (DERs) allow consumers to generate, trade, reduce, and shift their electricity consumption, largely bypassing traditional utilities. DERs can reduce consumer reliance on the grid, and in the most extreme scenario self-sufficient consumers could disconnect from the grid and avoid all external charges. However, since most DERs delivers energy, but not reliable capacity, it would be in the interests of most of these consumers to stay connected to the networks, in the event their system fails. Such a ‘pay as you go’ price scheme would not reflect the opportunity cost of electricity firms' sudden idle infrastructure though. This paper proposes a market mechanism that can ameliorate these distortions. We flesh out a solution based on the creation of a market of risk, enabled by a reassignment of property rights, where utilities trade reliability insurance services to households to protect them against the failure of their own DER system. Creating such an insurance market would allow customers to reflect their preference for reliability and pay accordingly.

AB  - The current research examines the difference between strong self-relevant (SR) customer-brand relationships (as represented by brand identification and self-brand connection) and strong self-neutral (SN) brand relationships (as represented by quality, satisfaction, and trust) in the context of service failure and recovery. Whereas strong SR relationships foster a sense of entitlement in customers after service failure, strong SN relationships foster forgiveness. As a result, SR relationships increase recovery expectations and subsequent complaint behavior whereas SN relationships decrease complaint behavior. Study 1 examines these effects using complaint behavior for airlines. Study 2 confirms these effects on survey data from hotel customers and Study 3 then explores the phenomenon more deeply in a controlled situation using scenario-based surveys. Viewed holistically, the results help further understanding of how a brand's deep, customer relationships can either become a thorn in the company's side or provide forbearance.

Further, we assess the role of service recovery in customer intentions after the service failure. The study findings contribute to the development of theory on the “other customers” effect by comparing the consequences of service failure directed at the focal customer and other customers and provide solutions to practitioners to reduce this damaging effect.

AB  - Modern society has become increasingly dependent on the resilience of critical infrastructures (CI), such as electricity distribution, telecommunications, and IT infrastructure. These systems can be interdependent in a variety of ways. The dependencies may lead to a situation where a failure in one system can cause failures in other systems. The comprehension of failure interdependencies is important for the continuous functioning of CI, especially from the viewpoints of preparedness and the response. The sector-specific interdependencies are usually well known but there is a lack of comprehension of the cross-sector interdependencies. This paper presents a qualitative method for identifying and describing the CI service failure interdependencies. The proposed method is a scenario-based approach in which CI stakeholders create a common understanding of the causes and effects of a described threat scenario. The method can be used to identify and describe the potential sector-specific and cross-sector failure interdependencies. Through the method, we have identified and described the interdependencies between the failures in CIs together with domain experts involved in the Finnish regional preparedness committees and experts working in high-level positions in CIs in Finland. The results of the case study can be utilized in the process of developing the preparedness and response activities in Finland. The method presented here can be applied in the process of identifying and describing the failure interdependencies in other countries and contexts.

T2  - Ocean & Coastal Management
AB  - Environmental and natural resource management in Australia occurs at a regional scale with many initiatives underpinned by an ecosystem services framework that aims to integrate economic, social and ecological values in decision-making. This research examines potential influences on value integration by identifying stakeholder perspectives for coastal ecosystem services using mangroves in south-east Queensland as a case study. The study site is one of Australia's fastest growing regions and exhibits a “hotbed of issues” with institutional complexity in coastal areas where urban development is concentrated. Q-methodology was used to systematically study stakeholder perspectives on coastal ecosystem services and identify natural groupings between stakeholders with shared values. A total of 43 respondents representing nine stakeholder categories were interviewed. Factor analysis identified four perspectives that were labelled: (1) Green Infrastructure; (2) Recreational Opportunity and Well-being; (3) Sustaining Regional Industries and Communities; and (4) Coastal Living. The concept of ecosystem ‘bundles’ was conducive to analysing the range of services valued by different perspectives and highlighted stakeholder priorities that underpin demand for coastal ecosystem services. Stakeholder perspectives show potential to influence coastal policy according to the ecosystem service categories that are prioritised in decision-making and the saliency of the services to the stakeholder group. This research contributes to the field of coastal management where a lack of progress on “well-documented problems” partly stems from governance failure to capture and consider pluralistic values in decision-making and exacerbates conflict between contested views.

T2  - Applied Mathematical Modelling
AB  - In this paper, a vehicle routing problem with interval demands is investigated based on the motivation of dispatching vehicles to deliver perishable products in practice. A nonlinear interval-based programming method is used to build a model for the vehicle routing problem with interval demands, which assumes that demands of customers are uncertain but fall in given intervals and actual demand of a customer becomes known only when the vehicle visited the customer. A vehicle-coordinated strategy was designed to solve the service failure problem. A hybrid algorithm based on the artificial immune system is also proposed to solve the model for vehicle routing problem with interval demands. The validity of methods and sensitivity analysis are illustrated by conducting some numerical examples. We find that the tolerant possibility degree of interval number has significant impacts on the distances. The planned distance strictly increased, while the additional distance strictly decreased and the total distance after coordinated transport has a U-typed relationship with the tolerant possibility degree of interval number.

T2  - 19th IFAC World Congress
AB  - Global competition has been leading to more complex production systems, in which satisfactory maintenance is crucial for the operations. The ability to properly forecast failures, provided by Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) can avoid downtimes and provide a competitive advantage. Moreover, it can also enable more precise demand planning in Spare Parts Supply Chain (SPSC), resulting in the availability of parts and services when they are necessary in shop floor, avoiding breakdowns and production interruptions. The proper integration of IMS and SPSC is of utmost importance to achieve these results. Some of the challenges related to this integration refer to semantic differences between these areas with diverse concepts and vocabulary. This work intends to propose the building of an ontology to overcome these difficulties by providing a common vocabulary and proper semantic integration of the areas, as a basis for the construction of a future integration information system to integrate IMS and SPSC.

T2  - Socio-Economic Planning Sciences
AB  - This paper re-evaluates the telecommunication policies often applied to create regional dispersion of services in developing countries. We observe that failure to consider the complexities of the regional telecommunication systems in creating policies and investment strategies has increased the telecom gap between urban and rural regions worldwide. In particular, the teledensities of rural telecommunications in developing countries have remained very low in spite of support through universal service obligation fees and cross-subsidization from international services. As traditional methods for economic analysis and modeling have failed to identify mechanisms that improve telephone dispersion in these countries, we use a system dynamics modeling approach to deal with complexities of the situation in order to evaluate how Universal Service Obligations (USOs) and International Cross-Subsidy (ICS) policies affect telephone densities. We demonstrate that these policies may be counterproductive due to the structure of the telecom system itself. We also show that, when market-clearing pricing is combined with USOs once the urban telephone density reaches a minimum threshold, the dispersion of rural telecommunications can be considerably improved.

AB  - The availability of power supply to power grid customers depends upon the availability of services of supervision, control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, which constitutes the nervous system of a power grid. In turn, SCADA services depend on the availability of the interconnected networks supporting such services. We propose a service oriented stochastic modelling methodology to investigate the availability of large interconnected networks, based on the hierarchical application of different modelling formalisms to different parts of the networks. Interconnected networks are decomposed according to the specific services delivered until the failure and repair mechanisms of the decomposed elementary blocks can be identified. We represent each network by a convenient stochastic modelling formalism, able to capture the main technological issues and to cope with realistic assumptions about failure and recovery mechanisms. This procedure confines the application of the more intensive computational techniques to those subsystems that actually require it. The paper concentrates on an actual failure scenario, occurred in Rome in January 2004 that involved the outage of critical SCADA communication links, interconnecting a power grid and a Telco network.

AB  - An improved understanding of failure risks for water supplies in rural sub-Saharan Africa will be critical to achieving the global goal of safe water for all by 2030. In the absence of longitudinal biophysical and operational data, investigations into water point failure risk factors have to date been limited to cross-sectional research designs. This retrospective cohort study applies survival analysis to identify factors that predict failure risks for handpumps installed on boreholes along the south coast of Kenya from the 1980s. The analysis is based on a unique dataset linking attributes of >300 water points at the time of installation with their operational lifespan over the following decades. Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models suggest water point failure risks are higher and lifespans are shorter when water supplied is more saline, static water level is deeper, and groundwater is pumped from an unconsolidated sand aquifer. The risk of failure also appears to grow as distance to spare part suppliers increases. To bolster the sustainability of rural water services and ensure no community is left behind, post-construction support mechanisms will need to mitigate heterogeneous environmental and geographical challenges. Further studies are needed to better understand the causal pathways that underlie these risk factors in order to inform policies and practices that ensure water services are sustained even where unfavourable conditions prevail.

TI  - Linking authentic leadership to salespeople's service performance: The roles of job crafting and human resource flexibility
AU  - Luu, Tuan Trong
T2  - Industrial Marketing Management
AB  - To build the sustainable service excellence, organizations should fuel sales employees’ drive to serve customers and recover service failures to their utmost satisfaction. The primary aim of our study is to delve into the role of authentic leadership in fostering customer-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and service recovery performance among sales employees. Respondents for our surveys comprised employees and managers from sales departments of pharmaceutical companies in Vietnam. The data analyses justified the positive relationships between authentic leadership and customer-oriented OCB as well as service recovery performance in a business to business (B2B) context. Job crafting served as a mediator for the links between authentic leadership and customer-oriented OCB as well as service recovery performance. Furthermore, human resource (HR) flexibility was found to play a moderating role for the effect of authentic leadership on job crafting among sales employees.

AU  - Manika, Danae

T2  - International Journal of Information Management
AB  - Service failure apologies on social media are a new crisis communication outlet trend used by companies to apologise to affected customers quickly and offer solutions, ultimately to restore customers' trust and brand loyalty. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on companies' social media service failure apologies and fills a gap in the social commerce literature by recognising that due to the open and public nature of social media, these apologies may reach not just affected customers, but also unintended audiences such as potential customers among the general public, which could potentially damage a company's reputation and market share. An online survey administered to 241 customers and 271 non-customers of a famous mobile phone brand, which used YouTube to apologise to its customers for a service failure incident, is used to explore potential behavioural outcomes, after exposure to the apology. Findings confirm that both customers and non-customers of the service provider may become exposed to a social media service failure apology. The hypothesised model predicts behavioural intentions to remain a customer after exposure to the social media service apology better than behavioural intentions to become a customer, even though relationships hold for both groups. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - Rising volatility in globally distributed supply networks leads to an increasing need of supply chain event management. Event-driven control requires sensor-based, real-time quality data. The article presents necessary capabilities of sensors and sensor networks to realize such event-driven control mechanisms. Based on a failure modes and effect analysis of automotive supply chains, the sensor requirements are identified and discussed. A discrete event simulation evaluates the effects of quality data for event-driven control. In addition to the real-time ability, further capabilities regarding communication, energy, granularity, identification and data storage are identified. The derived capabilities are the basis to develop event-driven architectures.

T2  - Reliability Engineering & System Safety
AB  - We study a problem faced by a service provider, who is responsible for the repair of a group of assets subject to random failures. In case of a failure, both an engineer and a spare part of the right kind need to be available to carry out the repair. A limited number of engineers are employed while also stocks of the various spare parts are limited. In case any resource (engineer or spare part) is not immediately available, the service provider may follow a full backlogging policy. Alternatively, in case of spare parts stock out, he has the option to revert to an emergency supplier with ample capacity of resources. We present an original model to analyze the problem dynamics between this service provider and the emergency supplier. Especially, we determine the optimal emergency shipment cost and the optimal multi-resource level of the service provider. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to find the Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, we design a revenue-sharing cooperative contract between these players which always results in coordination. Finally, we examine the risk of uncertainties in such a contract and find the optimal contract parameters by considering the utility functions of the players.

AB  - Studies of service assume that service failures are solely attributable to incompetence or ineptitude. This is contrary to studies which find that service workers routinely act in deviant ways. In Study 1, we aim to explore the extent to which tourists believe that they have been ripped off by service workers. This study finds that 48% of all tourists and 56% of international tourists believe that service personnel have ripped them off. In Study 2, the aim is to investigate how service workers exploit their role to undertake acts of deception. This study finds that some service workers deliberately target tourists to dupe then into paying more for services than non-tourist customers. The paper culminates with a discussion of implications.

T2  - Computers & Chemical Engineering
AB  - An optimization model is proposed to redesign the supply chain of spare part delivery under demand uncertainty from strategic and tactical perspectives in a planning horizon consisting of multiple periods. Long term decisions involve new installations, expansions and elimination of warehouses and factories handling multiple products. It is also considered which warehouses should be used as repair work-shops in order to store, repair and deliver used units to customers. Tactical planning includes deciding inventory levels (safety stock and expected inventory) for each type of spare part in distribution centers and customer plants, as well as the connection links between the supply chain nodes. Capacity constraints are also taken into account when planning inventory levels. At the tactical level it is determined how demand of failing units is satisfied, and whether to use new or used parts. The uncertain demand is addressed by defining the optimal amount of safety stock that guarantees certain service level at a customer plant. In addition, the risk-pooling effect is taken into account when defining inventory levels in distribution centers and customer zones. Due to the nonlinear nature of the original formulation, a piece-wise linearization approach is applied to obtain a tight lower bound of the optimal solution. The formulation can be adapted to several industry-critical units and the supply chain of electric motors is provided here as an example.

TI  - Market instruments, ecosystem services, and property rights: Assumptions and conditions for sustained social and ecological benefits
AU  - Lockie, Stewart
T2  - Themed Issue 1-Guest Editor Romy GreinerThemed Issue 2- Guest Editor Davide Viaggi
AB  - Market-based instruments (MBIs) are promoted as economically efficient, targeted solutions to otherwise intractable environmental policy problems with additional potential to improve the livelihood security of ecosystem service providers. This paper argues that the effectiveness of MBIs (and the likelihood therefore of sustained environmental and social outcomes) depends on a number of often unacknowledged assumptions about the distribution of benefits arising from ecosystem service provision, the rights and duties associated with resource access, and the fitness for purpose of various policy instruments. These assumptions are illustrated and discussed using The Benefit Flows and Property Rights Matrix. It is argued that the legitimacy of MBIs depends both on the demonstrability of distinct public benefit and of acceptance among the wider community that private resource users ought to be compensated in some way for the provision of that benefit. Effective provision of ecosystem services through a market-mechanism thereafter depends on a range of additional conditions including inter-changeability of supply, scalability, lack of corroboration, adequate information, financial capacity, clarity of property rights, clarity of resource access-related duties and institutional capacity. Meeting these conditions is not simply a matter of appropriate incentive design but of political decision-making, moral judgement and social learning. Failure to recognise these conditions potentially undermines the effectiveness not only of MBIs but of alternative policy measures taken contemporaneously with MBIs such as community-based natural resource management.

AB  - Given that e-tailing service failure is inevitable, a better understanding of how service failure and recovery affect customer loyalty represents an important topic for academics and practitioners. This study explores the relationship of service failure severity, service recovery justice (i.e., interactional justice, procedural justice, and distributive justice), and perceived switching costs with customer loyalty; as well, the moderating relationship of service recovery justice and perceived switching costs on the link between service failure severity and customer loyalty in the context of e-tailing are investigated. Data collected from 221 useful respondents are tested against the research model using the partial least squares (PLS) approach. The results indicate that service failure severity, interactional justice, procedural justice and perceived switching costs have a significant relationship with customer loyalty, and that interactional justice can mitigate the negative relationship between service failure severity and customer loyalty. These findings provide several important theoretical and practical implications in terms of e-tailing service failure and recovery.

AB  - Incidents of customer-to-customer aisle rage are on the rise, which raises questions about their triggers and outcomes, including customer responses that may affect the firm where the incidents take place. The results of 329 Critical Incident Technique interviews categorize triggers as interpersonal or situational, and suggest situational triggers that are under the firm's control (e.g., hunger, crowdedness, long waits for service) frequently co-occur with behaviors that negatively impact the firm (e.g., physical expressions of rage, exit, and revenge). Another important contribution is the identification of new responses to rage, including: commiserating with other customers, responding with humor/sarcasm, and boycotting the service provider because of shame or regret about personal reactions to the rage-inducing incidents. The results build on Affective Events Theory (AET) and contribute to our understanding of customer coping in customer-to-customer interactions.

Aiming at these problems, a new agent-based service-oriented integration architecture was proposed for chemical process automation system. Web services were dynamically orchestrated on the internet and agent behaviors were built in them. Data analysis, model, optimization, control, fault diagnosis and so on were capsuled into different web services. Agents were used for service compositions by negotiation. A prototype system of poly(ethylene terephthalate) process automation was used as the case study to demonstrate the validation of the integration.

T2  - Special Issue Operations management, entrepreneurship, and value creation:Emerging opportunities in a cross-disciplinary context
AB  - This paper contributes to the emerging area of e-service strategy in the context of business-to-business (B2B) e-marketplaces, which we view as Internet-based service delivery systems that link sellers’ offerings to buyers. Although a myriad of new B2B e-marketplaces were launched over the past decade, a substantial number failed shortly after the peak of the NASDAQ in 2000. The bursting of the Internet bubble provides a setting for assessing salient, theory-based determinants of failure—and success. Accordingly, we apply a service operations strategy lens and complementary organizational theories to explain how three strategic factors—industrial sector characteristics, ownership structure, and functionality of service offering—may have influenced B2B e-marketplaces’ odds of survival after the bubble. We empirically test these factors using logistic regression analysis on a sample of 854 B2B e-marketplaces. Consistent with emerging e-services literature, our empirical results indicate that B2B e-marketplaces serving industrial sectors that are a better fit with the Internet service delivery systems—by high information dependence and low information tacitness—have the highest likelihood of success, as do e-marketplaces with service offerings that facilitate collaboration among multiple buyers and sellers. We also demonstrate the positive influence of consortium ownership structure on B2B e-marketplace survival, albeit not for first-mover consortia-backed e-marketplaces. Our findings contribute to the service operations strategy literature and provide direction for managers in the areas of e-service strategy and investment.

T2  - Journal of Systems and Software
AB  - Being a popular runtime infrastructure in the era of Internet, middleware provides more and more services to support the development, deployment and management of distributed systems. At the same time, the reliability of middleware services has a significant impact on the overall reliability of the system. Different services have different impacts and different service fault-tolerance solutions have different costs and risks. Therefore, the identification of the services that greatly affect the whole system reliability is the major obstacle to achieving reliable middleware-based systems. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to automatically reason and quantify such impacts when deploying the target system. In this framework, faults are represented by exceptions in modern programming languages; service failures are simulated by software fault injection; reliability impacts are measured by scenarios. This framework is demonstrated on multiple JEE application servers, including JBoss, JonAS and PKUAS. The experiments on two JEE blueprint applications, namely JPS and ECperf, show the feasibility, the applicability and the usability of this framework.

AB  - The continuing absence of innovation in Europe’s mobile services industry is identified and characterised here, with such examples as mobile Internet and mobile music. Innovation failure is a critical factor leading to a lack of high-income jobs, network effects, and price reductions for data services. Most mobile service innovations have been made in Japan in ‘clubs of operators’ with their suppliers. Apple USA followed the same model of control with its iPhone. Conversely, a lack of this critical type of competition characterises European operators. Revenues per citizen are in some countries similar to those in Japan, but with handsets with less functions. Europe and all other regions face the challenge of competing with Japanese and US innovators. The lessons to be learned are (1) becoming aware of the situation, (2) allocating spectrum that covers a sufficient population size to allow technological competition, and (3) developing a strong customer orientation.

Our empirical analysis, based on data from the Offshoring Research Network, shows that both arguments hold. Moreover, when offshoring had been motivated by accessing to new markets and its performance is unsatisfactory, companies are likely to relocate. However, unsatisfactory performance of activities offshored for efficiency reasons or search of talent, do not necessarily lead companies to relocate elsewhere.

T2  - Performance Evaluation
AB  - We consider a single-server queuing model with energy harvesting. Customers and energy units arrive in the marked Markovian arrival flow. Buffers for customers and energy are finite. There are several service modes distinguished by the number of required units of energy, the service rate and the quality of service. The choice of the service mode for the next customer depends on the current number of energy units in the system. The quality of system operation is assumed to be defined by a customer’s loss probability. Loss can occur due to buffer overflow, low-quality service or impatience during the waiting time. The control strategy is of a multi-threshold type with thresholds defined by the amount of available energy. Under the fixed values of the thresholds, the behaviour of the system is described by a multi-dimensional Markov chain. The generator of this chain is derived. The main performance measures are calculated. The distribution of the waiting time is derived in explicit form. A numerical study of the model via extensive experiments that provide insight into the quantitative behaviour of the system is presented.

TI  - Planning rural water services in Nicaragua: A systems-based analysis of impact factors using graphical modeling
AU  - Walters, Jeffrey P.
AU  - Chinowsky, Paul S.
T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - The success or failure of rural water services in the developing world is a result of numerous factors that interact in a complex set of connections that are difficult to separate and identify. This research effort presented a novel means to empirically reveal the systemic interactions of factors that influence rural water service sustainability in the municipalities of Darío and Terrabona, Nicaragua. To accomplish this, the study employed graphical modeling to build and analyze factor networks. Influential factors were first identified by qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing transcribed interviews from community water committee members. Factor influences were then inferred by graphical modeling to create factor network diagrams that revealed the direct and indirect interaction of factors. Finally, network analysis measures were used to identify “impact factors” based on their relative influence within each factor network. Findings from this study elucidated the systematic nature of such factor interactions in both Darío and Terrabona, and highlighted key areas for programmatic impact on water service sustainability for both municipalities. Specifically, in Darío, the impact areas related to the current importance of water service management by community water committees, while in Terrabona, the impact areas related to the current importance of finances, viable water sources, and community capacity building by external support. Overall, this study presents a rigorous and useful means to identify impact factors as a way to facilitate the thoughtful planning and evaluation of sustainable rural water services in Nicaragua and beyond.

TI  - Critical infrastructure location under supporting station dependencies considerations
AU  - Jamar Kattel, Prakash
AU  - Aros-Vera, Felipe
T2  - Socio-Economic Planning Sciences
AB  - This paper develops a framework to locate critical infrastructure (CI) facilities to most fully capitalize on the supporting stations (SSs) they depend on for normal operation. CI facilities include health services, transportation and electricity; agencies that impact the national economy, security and the public's health and wellbeing. SSs are facilities that provide essential services for the regular operation of a CI. For instance, the power service, communication services and water supply services are SSs for Hospitals. In this paper SSs are independent from the CIs that they service and have a heterogeneous probability of failure that will cripple the dependent CI. The proposed framework ranks the SS according to its cost of providing service such that the rank-1 SS is the primary service provider and incorporates the probability of failure for the SS. The CI will be served from secondary SS if the primary fails due to a disaster. This formulation insures the continuous service to the CI from SS and determines both the optimal location of the CI and the optimal number of demands served. A mixed integer linear programming approach is applied to develop a Reliable Facility Location Problem considering Supporting Stations (RFLP-SS) to identify the optimal location to build a critical facility. In addition to that, The RFLP-SS determines the capacity of the optimally located facility and its allocated demands. This research highlights the importance of considering dependencies among the SSs that service CI. The paper presents a case study in Puerto Rico to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. The case study investigates the status of health services in Puerto Rico, and identifies the optimal locations to establish new hospitals. The paper recommends 11 locations for new hospitals so that the people of Puerto Rico will be better served than they are currently.

AU  - Cohen, M.A.
T2  - International Journal of Production Economics
AB  - We consider the integrated planning of spare parts and service engineers that are needed for serving a group of systems. These systems are subject to different failure types, and for each failure, a service engineer with the necessary spare part has to be assigned to repair the system. The service provider follows a backlogging policy with part reservations. That is, a repair request is backlogged if one of the required resources is not immediately available upon demand. Moreover, a spare part is reserved if the requested spare part is in stock but no service engineer is immediately available. The spare parts are typically slow-movers and are managed according to a base-stock policy. The objective is to jointly determine the stock levels and the number of service engineers to minimize the total service costs subject to a constraint on the expected total waiting times of the repair calls. For the evaluation of a given setting, we present an exact method (computationally feasible for small problems) and an accurate approximation. For the joint optimization, we present a greedy heuristic that efficiently produces close-to-optimal results. We test how the heuristic performs compared to the optimal solution and the separate optimization of spare parts and service engineers in an extensive numerical study. In a case study with 93 types of spare parts, we show that the solution of the greedy algorithm is always within 2% of the optimal solution and is up to 20% better than a separated optimization approach encountered in practice.

AB  - Full-service repair contracts are becoming increasingly popular, especially as an add-on to leasing contracts for technical investment products. This paper presents a model for pricing full-service repair contracts in the presence of risk-averse customers. The model identifies the optimal portfolio of full-service contracts and on-call service agreements to be offered by the service provider. The optimal full-service price is established, with failure arrivals being modeled as Poisson events and the cost of individual failures being stochastic. An existing on-call service business represents the price benchmark. The model is readily applicable for any service provider for small investment products such as special-purpose trucks or printing equipment.

AU  - Modi, Sachin B.

T2  - Service Triads: A Research Agenda for Buyer-Supplier-Customer Triads in Business Services
AB  - The rise in front-end service outsourcing in recent years, despite its advantages, has also exposed buyer firms to unique challenges. One of the most salient risks for buyer firms in service triads is service failure due to the service provider. Indeed such service failures may be more costly for firms due to the greater relational and operational costs that may arise from the presence of the third-party provider. Yet, neither the services literature nor extant operations literature on service triads has paid much attention to the financial consequences to the buyer firm – i.e., service risks – of such service failures in triads. To fill this gap, we investigate the financial penalty of service failures due to the service provider using the event study methodology and a sample of 146 customer information security breaches as our empirical context. Analysis of the abnormal returns reveals that service failures due to the front-end service provider lead to greater shareholder losses than such failures due to the buyer firm. This provides important new insight into the financial risks arising from outsourcing front-end services. Further, we investigate the ability of the buyer firm's employee and financial resources to temper these shareholder losses. We find that buyer firm employee productivity can moderate the greater financial penalty associated with such triadic service failures but that buyer firm leverage tends to not have such a mitigating effect. This provides new guidance for theory and practice regarding how buyer firms can position themselves to buffer the financial risks arising from service failures due to front-end service providers.

TI  - The path to outcome delivery: Interplay of service market strategy and open business models
AU  - Visnjic, Ivanka
AU  - Neely, Andy
AU  - Jovanovic, Marin
T2  - Technovation
AB  - Firms in a variety of manufacturing sectors as well as the software industry have increasingly embraced services alongside their product portfolios in order to improve financial performance. Yet, the key question “How do service market strategy change and the accompanying business model change interact, and how does their interplay affect value creation?” remains open. Relying on twelve case studies of firms that have shifted towards providing highly advanced services (e.g. outcome-based contracts), theoretical propositions concerning the interplay of market strategy and business model on value creation are derived. The firms studied report two interdependent changes: first, they evolve the market strategy from provision of pure products to provision of services and then outcomes, in order to achieve a better fit with customer needs and to grow their service businesses. Second, they rely increasingly on partners and suppliers to provide new activities that are outside their competence base. This 'open business model' allows them to grow their new service businesses effectively and efficiently. At the same time, however, the shift to a service market strategy requires enhanced accountability to customers and increases the threat of penalties in the case of failure, while reliance on partners and suppliers leads to loss of control over the activity system and increases the threat of failure due to third party dependency. Thus, this paper finds that the success of firms that shift to services and outcomes hinges on their ability to balance the trade-off between increased value (i.e. growth, efficiency and effectiveness) and increased uncertainty associated with service market strategy/open business model interplay.

AU  - Wileman, A.J.

T2  - 2nd International Through-life Engineering Services Conference
AB  - The impact that modern wireless communications plays in our everyday lives is huge. A great deal of our day to day operation, be it commercial, civil or defence relies on the ability to deploy these technologies reliably, with the minimum of failure. This paper presents a system based Prognostic Health Management (PHM) methodology for health monitoring and prognostics within a RF transceiver chain, with the ability to provide impending detection of individual system component failure. The primary focus of this paper is towards military assets such as radar and electronic warfare (EW) systems, but it is envisaged that it will have other connotations in helping to provide quality of service (QoS) in wireless communications as well as civilian radar systems. Methods of failure modes and degradation in RF devices are examined before suggesting a methodology where parametric data may be extracted for health monitoring by non-linear techniques. This data is then compared to an ideal healthy transceiver by the use of a metric employing the Mahalanobis distance. A prognostic is applied in the form a sequential Monte-Carlo method by the use of a particle filter to give an approximation of remaining useful life (RUL).

AU  - Ilukor, John
AU  - Birner, Regina

T2  - Preventive Veterinary Medicine
AB  - Providing adequate animal health services to smallholder farmers in developing countries has remained a challenge, in spite of various reform efforts during the past decades. The focuses of the past reforms were on market failures to decide what the public sector, the private sector, and the “third sector” (the community-based sector) should do with regard to providing animal health services. However, such frameworks have paid limited attention to the governance challenges inherent in the provision of animal health services. This paper presents a framework for analyzing institutional arrangements for providing animal health services that focus not only on market failures, but also on governance challenges, such as elite capture, and absenteeism of staff. As an analytical basis, Williamson’s discriminating alignment hypothesis is applied to assess the cost-effectiveness of different institutional arrangements for animal health services in view of both market failures and governance challenges. This framework is used to generate testable hypotheses on the appropriateness of different institutional arrangements for providing animal health services, depending on context-specific circumstances. Data from Uganda and Kenya on clinical veterinary services is used to provide an empirical test of these hypotheses and to demonstrate application of Williamson's transaction cost theory to veterinary service delivery. The paper concludes that strong public sector involvement, especially in building and strengthening a synergistic relation-based referral arrangement between paraprofessionals and veterinarians is imperative in improving animal health service delivery in developing countries.

AB  - Abstract:
The current phase of global economy competitiveness under economic downturn are pushing many sectors related to manufacturing industry to adapt and discover new ways to make profitable businesses. In particular, there is a trend for manufacturers towards service oriented business models: That is selling the usage or even the product performance. However, these new business completely change the manufacturer’s perspective over the costs and revenues arising during the product lifecycle, and therefore the relevance of concepts such as life cycle costs or maintenance management strongly increases. Thus, the reduction of costs related to the product usage and maintenance is mandatory in order to achieve a profitable business. This paper presents an example of this transition to service oriented business models. In particular, it presents the business opportunities of an SME that produces forklift truck solutions. The paper will focus on how maintenance technologies are enabling the generation of new service oriented business and how these new technologies do influence in the main KPIs of the company.

T2  - Agricultural Systems
AB  - A multitude of approaches and modalities are available for delivering useful information to rural communities. However, evidence regarding the information efficiency of these modalities is limited, as are studies identifying the mechanisms of potential information loss in the agricultural extension system. In this paper, we assess information efficiency along the knowledge transmission chain from researchers to agricultural extension agents (EAs) to lead farmers (LFs) to other farmers. By asking the same set of questions about a fairly well known technology, pit planting, we construct a measure of knowledge at each node of the knowledge transmission chain. Evidence shows that the majority of information loss happens at the researcher-to-EA link and the EA-to-LF link, and that the loss is potentially caused by teaching failures or by selective attention and learning among both the EAs and the LFs concerning all important details of the technology. Results highlight the need for greater emphasis during training and learning on key dimensions of technology packages that are commonly ignored.

T2  - Research and Innovation in Manufacturing: Key Enabling Technologies for the Factories of the Future - Proceedings of the 48th CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems
AB  - In today's evermore complex manufacturing systems, effective and efficient maintenance has become crucial for achieving operational competitive advantages. Breakdowns and system failures caused by insufficient maintenance can lead to significant economic impact such as higher costs, diminishing profits and declined customer satisfaction. In order to avoid unforeseen systems’ unavailability, it is necessary to accurately and precisely forecast maintenance demand in advance – including the provision of maintenance services and spare parts. Moreover, the management and planning of spare parts supply chains has become more important in order to ensure the availability of spare parts and maintenance personnel at the required location and time while operating at reasonable costs. Both issues are recently targeted by the research domains of intelligent maintenance systems (IMS) – forecasting machine failures using a condition-based maintenance (CBM) approach – and spare parts supply chains (SPSC) – planning and providing related maintenance services and spare parts. A proper integration of these two domains enables the exchange of relevant information that could be applied for advanced failure forecasting, machine control and SPSC planning. However, the challenge of integrating both domains is to deal with the different meanings and knowledge, e.g., the concepts being applied in both domains vary in their level of granularity and importance. This paper addresses the integration problem of IMS devices and SPSC planning systems by presenting a refined ontology including concepts that semantically connect the different systems and thus provides the basis for a conceptual integration architecture and a deduced service-oriented architecture facilitating dynamic communication services to support the information exchange. Furthermore, the applied design of the ontology is described for an industrial case and the application potentials to be achieved by the integration of both system types are highlighted.

AU  - Wang, Xiaotian

T2  - Transportation Research Part B: Methodological
AB  - Reservation-based parking systems have the merit of eliminating vehicle cruising for parking. While many long-period (e.g., daily) parking reservation services are already in use, short-period (e.g., hourly) parking reservation remains a huge challenge due to the high uncertainty of customer arrivals and departures. To mitigate the service failure caused by random late departures of customers, we propose a new flexible reservation mechanism in which the reservation is no longer restricted to a specific location at a specific time, but tolerates predetermined spatiotemporal flexibility instead. With a pricing instrument designed for such parking flexibility, customers can coordinate to significantly reduce the reservation failure rate, resulting in an optimal system equilibrium benefiting the entire society. Due to the complex nature of this system, a continuum approximation framework is used to provide tractable analysis for a large-scale urban parking system. We can successfully provide accurate system management decision support with a bounded optimality gap and analytical insights.

AB  - As cloud data center has caught the eye of the information-intensive society since its birth, it keeps on a flourishing development due to its advantages such as high availability and resource utilization, rapid elasticity and disaster recovery. However, as a complex system, it means the centralization of failures and risks, which exerts great influence on the service that cloud data center provides to customers. Thus, the service reliability of the cloud data center is always a key concern. In order to evaluate and further improve the service reliability of the cloud data center, modeling analysis is absolutely necessary but difficult to apply because of the complicated cloud control flows, massive-scale service sharing and complex real-world infrastructures. Focused on the active-active data center, which is a typical mode of the cloud data center, a methodology of the service reliability modeling and analysis based on IT infrastructure is proposed. In this methodology, the queuing theory and graph theory are used to formulate the service reliability model, but the Monte Carlo simulation is used for statistical evaluation. During the modeling, the operational process of the active-active data center is divided into two parts—the request stage and execution stage, which are modeled respectively. Then, the modeling and evaluation approaches are applied in a use case, which verifies the applicability and creditability of our approach. Meanwhile, by sensitivity analysis considering the variation of uncertain or key factors both internal and external, several parameters are identified as high-sensitive factors, which can enlighten service providers on service reliability improvement.

AB  - Despite the huge success of the Internet in providing basic communication services, its economic architecture needs to be upgraded so as to provide end-to-end guaranteed or more reliable services to its customers. Currently, a user or an enterprise that needs end-to-end bandwidth guarantees between two arbitrary points in the Internet for a short period of time has no way of expressing its needs. To allow these much needed basic services, we propose a single-domain edge-to-edge (g2g) dynamic capacity contracting mechanism, where a network customer can enter into a bandwidth contract on a g2g path at a future time, at a predetermined price. For practical and economic viability, such forward contracts must involve a bailout option to account for bandwidth becoming unavailable at service delivery time, and must be priced appropriately to enable Internet Service Providers (ISPs) manage risks in their contracting and investments. Our design allows ISPs to advertise point-to-point different prices for each of their g2g paths instead of the current point-to-anywhere prices, allowing discovery of better end-to-end paths, temporal flexibility and efficiency of bandwidth usage. We compute the risk-neutral prices for these g2g bailout forward contracts (BFCs), taking into account correlations between different contracts due to correlated demand patterns and overlapping paths. We apply this multiple g2g BFC framework on network models with Rocketfuel topologies. We evaluate our contracting mechanism in terms of key network performance metrics like fraction of bailouts, revenue earned by the provider, and adaptability to link failures. We also explore the tradeoffs between complexity of pricing and performance benefits of our BFC mechanism.

TI  - A bi-objective stochastic model for emergency medical services network design with backup services for disasters under disruptions: An earthquake case study
AU  - Mohamadi, Ahmad

T2  - International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction
AB  - In the event of a disaster such as natural and human-made, high demand for medical supplies and a large number of injured people will emerge at the affected areas in a short time period. Rapid distribution of medical supplies and the speed of transferring injured to the hospital play an important role in assuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the emergency medical service (EMS). In this paper, a bi-objective stochastic optimization model is developed for location of transfer points and medical supplies distribution centers (MSDCs). When a disaster happens, resources are usually insufficient for all to be treated immediately. For this reason, determining the priority of injured treatments based on the severity of their condition is one the most important issue on EMS, called as triage system. Therefore, for approaching the model to the real world, triage system and failure probabilities of MSDCs and routes are considered. To enhance efficiency of services during such event, backup MSDCs are also utilized. Furthermore, the proposed bi-objective model is converted to a single-objective mixed-integer programming model applying the ε-constraint method. Finally, to show applicability of the model, a case study of earthquake disaster in an urban district in Iran is examined. The proposed model can help interdisciplinary agencies both to prepare and respond to disaster considering the disruption in an efficient manner.

TI  - Critique and transformation: On the hypothetical nature of ecosystem service value and its neo-Marxist, liberal and pragmatist criticisms
AU  - Melathopoulos, Andony P.
AU  - Stoner, Alexander M.
T2  - Ecological Economics
AB  - Ecosystem service valuation (ESV) attempts to transform the opposition of human economic necessity and ecological conservation by valuing the latter in terms of the services rendered by the former. However, despite a number of ESV-inspired sustainability initiatives since the 1990s, global ecological degradation continues to accelerate. This suggests that ESV has fallen far short of its goals of sustainable social transformation—a failure which has generated considerable criticism. This paper reviews three prominent lines of ESV criticism: 1) the neo-Marxist criticism, which emphasizes the “fictitious” character of ecosystem commodities; 2) the liberal criticism through Friedrich Hayek's concept “scientistic objectivism”; and 3) the pragmatist criticism of “value monism”. Although each form of criticism provides insight into the limitations of ESV, all share ESV's inability to discern what kind of social transformation is possible. Unable to provide an account of their own immersion in social and historical context, these approaches operate in the hypothetical. In light of these shortcomings, this paper advances a critical theory approach, which we contend provides conceptual tools uniquely well-suited to more adequately address the question of social transformation.

AB  - The cloud of things (CoT) is an emerging paradigm that has merged and combined cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). Such a paradigm has enabled service providers to provide on-demand computing resources from devices spread across different locations for service users to be dynamically connected to them. While this benefits the CoT service providers and users in many ways, it also brings a key challenge of ensuring that the service is delivered according to the promised quality. Failure to ensure this will result in the service provider experiencing penalties of different types and the service user experiencing disruptions. The literature addresses this problem by proactively managing for SLA violations. However, given the geographically dispersed region of a formed CoT service, in this paper we argue that for proactive SLA violation identification, we need specialized techniques that also consider events that are outside the usual control of service providers and users, but will impact the CoT environment and the quality of service. We propose a framework that identifies such external events of interest and ascertains their impact on achieving the service according to the promised quality. We explain the working of our proposed framework in detail and demonstrate its superiority in proactively determining SLA violations as compared to existing approaches.

T2  - European Journal of Operational Research
AB  - We analyze the joint optimization of spare parts inventories and workforce allocation in a single-site maintenance system. In this system, for each failure, a service engineer with a necessary replacement part has to be allocated. If one of the required resources is not available, the incoming failure request is routed to an external provider, such as a centralized repair facility or a sub-contractor. We study multiple failure types (related to failing components) with exponentially distributed inter-failure times. The system repair times and the replenishment times of the spare parts inventory are also exponentially distributed. The inventory replenishment is done according to a Base-Stock policy. The objective is to minimize the total system cost consisting of annual holding costs of the spare parts and the service engineers, and incidental outsourcing costs. For the joint optimization of the resources, we propose a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) formulation using the balance equations of the Markov Chain representation of the system. Furthermore, we provide a simple and efficient heuristic that produces close-to-optimal (< 0.3% difference) results, for solving larger instances. Using the proposed optimization methods and real-life data, we analyze the optimal balance between the costs of the resources and the outsourcing costs and show how the outsourcing rates and the total costs behave for different system parameters.

The study begins with a reproduction of the service conditions in a traction gear. An analysis of the fracture surfaces revealed the existence of defects in the interior of the parts. With the aim of determining the origin of the imperfections and their influence on the failure, an exhaustive mechanical and rheological characterization of the material was carried out. The development of an FE Analysis established that the reduction of the tensile strength of the part due to internal defects was around 70%. Tests also showed that the most stressed area was the area where the most defects appeared. A simulation of the injection process showed that the defects are caused by the geometry of the part, leading to the conclusion that its failure was caused by bad dimensioning of thicknesses.

TI  - A Mapping Network Model Integrating Service to Warrant Function Availability of Complex Electro-mechanical Products
AU  - Chang, Fengtian

T2  - The 24th CIRP Conference on Life Cycle Engineering
AB  - In recent years, in order to obtain value increment of enterprises, product service system (PSS) that integrates products and services is attracting more and more attentions in life cycle. Meanwhile, in the product usage phase, the maintenance actions undertaken in-house by customers haven’t fully warranted products’ availability for increasingly complex electro-mechanical products. So, for the purpose of warranting function availability (i.e. the availability of a function for operation) and improving equipment's operation performance by integrating services, it is necessary to allow for the complex interactive relationships among functions, structures and services to implement service's integration. According to the research on PSS, to further discuss the integrating and mapping process from the standpoint of network modeling, the mapping network model integrating service is proposed. Concretely, this model includes function layer, structure layer, service layer and their mapping network relationships. In function layer, a multi-view function decomposition model with hierarchical design structure matrix (HDSM) is introduced to present function nodes and their inherent correlations, comprehensively. In structure layer, the structure nodes are mapped from normalized mapping process and their interdependence relationships are also quantified to fulfill the integration of structure network. In service layer, the concept of service activity chain (SAC) is presented to fulfill the mapping from structure nodes to service nodes with the advantage of failure tree analysis (FTA). What's more, the provider nodes are also integrated in it. Thereby, once the network is built, the functions of equipment could be warranted effectively by corresponding structures and service execution processes. In the end, a simple case of honing head subassembly of CNC honing machine 2MK2263×200 is studied to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB  - In late 2005 the lower stretches of the Olifants river in South Africa, flowing through the Kruger National Park before entering Mocambique, dried up for 78days, curtailing critical ecosystem services. Our retrospective case study attributes this to failure of effective cross-scale collaboration and co-constructed action. We detail how a more effective response was mounted after the governance crisis had first deepened, which, along with more recent broader but related societal responses, has maintained these water-related ecosystem services. The narrative describes part crisis response, part chance emergence, and along the way building of trust. Persistent staff capacity across agencies, whose members developed a sufficiently overlapping vision, was deemed crucial. The widening of linkages across scales and levels was a key feature, though attention is drawn to other important factors such as power dynamics. The difficulties encountered gave birth to new hope, with full recognition that such messy and dynamic social-ecological systems need to be navigated as best possible using complexity-friendly adaptive approaches, containing elements (including important cross-scale ones) that came together in this case. This case narrative is believed to contain generic lessons for ecosystem service governance.

AB  - Orchestrating services in nomadic or mobile ad hoc networks is not without a challenge, since these environments are built upon volatile connections. Services residing on mobile devices are exposed to (temporary) network failures, which must be considered the rule rather than the exception. This paper proposes a dedicated workflow language built on top of an ambient-oriented programming language that supports dynamic service discovery and communication primitives resilient to network failures. The proposed workflow language, NOW, has support for high level workflow abstractions for control flow, rich network and service failure detection, and failure handling through compensating actions, and dynamic data flow between the services in the environment. By adding this extra layer of abstraction, the application programmer is offered a flexible way to develop applications for nomadic networks.

AB  - Energy inefficiency in the building stock is a substantial contributor to climate change. Integrated energy service companies (IESCs) have a potentially important role in improving energy efficiency. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the energy efficiency barriers in the Finnish building sector based on data from interviews with twelve IESCs. Taking a novel supply side perspective, we place IESCs at the centre of the emerging energy services business ecosystem to identify the barriers and hindering factors (real world illustrations of barriers). From this perspective, we also examine cause-effect relationships between the hindering factors and the actors. Hindering factors, reported by IESCs, were categorised under a revised barrier taxonomy consisting of economic market failures and economic market, behavioural, organisational and institutional barriers. The most salient hindering factors—lack of technical skills, disinterest in energy efficiency improvements and non-functional regulation—were analysed with respect to ecosystem actors causing and affected by these factors. Public actors have a key role in overcoming these barriers, for instance, by creating new possibilities for entrants to take part in decision-making, increasing the functionality and practicality of policies and by providing up-to date energy efficiency information.

T2  - The Asian Journal of Shipping and Logistics
AB  - ABSTRACT
Warehousing is a crucial industry for trade-dependent nations like Malaysia. According to the World Bank Logistic Performance Index (LPI) 2016, Malaysia was ranked number 32 out of 160 countries in 2016, as against number 25 in 2014, despite a high level of warehouse activity during that year. The decrease in ranking was due to low warehouse productivity in Malaysia. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to consider ten parameters to assess the failure factors of warehouse productivity in the Malaysian logistics service sector, by applying a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method. The findings highlighted the top three failure factors that influence the levels of warehouse productivity in the Malaysian logistics service sector as being ‘labour productivity’, ‘warehouse utilisation’ and ‘inventory space utilisation’. This study contributes to the empowerment of warehouse productivity in the industry, in alignment with Malaysia's aspirational 2020 economic target. Consequently, this study provides new knowledge on warehouse productivity issues that will benefit decision makers in the warehouse industry. This research may enable decision makers to recognise problematic factors when planning their warehouse productivity improvement strategy, which may contribute to fulfilling government targets and empowering the national economy.

AU  - Hayes, Jan

T2  - Special Issue on societal safety, critical infrastructure reliability and related intersectoral governance.
AB  - The network of high pressure natural gas pipelines under our towns and cities operates with little public or academic attention. Since the pipelines are buried, they are largely invisible and awareness is low until there is a serious accident (e.g. Ghislenghien, San Bruno). Importantly, pipeline integrity is threatened by activities of third parties outside the pipeline sector such as local councils, other utilities and civil contractors doing work on other kinds of infrastructure. This paper focuses on how Dial Before You Dig (DBYD) – Australia’s one-call service for those doing civil works – functions at the boundary between the social worlds of various relevant actors. Drawing on more than 50 interviews with those involved in work near pipelines, we conceptualize DBYD asa boundary object. The pipeline sector sees DBYD asan effective system that minimizes risk to their assets. Those working near pipelines see it asa system that should support their own business goals. Nevertheless, the interpretive flexibility of DBYD allows cooperation without complete consensus. The boundary object framework reveals three key aspects of the social architecture provided by DBYD – the extent to which temporal considerations vary, the way in which the system institutionalises conflict and how DBYD constitutes a form of surveillance by one sector over another. The paper argues that as more essential services, including those that are potentially hazardous, are located in the ‘crowded underground’ below our cities, it is more important than ever to understand how the relevant actors interact.

AU  - Martino, Simone

T2  - Science of The Total Environment
AB  - In the last 15 years, conservation has shifted increasingly towards perspectives based on the instrumental value of nature, where what counts is what provides benefits to humans. The ecosystem services framework embraces this vision of nature through monetary valuation of the environment to correct market failures and government distortions that hinder efficient allocation of public goods, including goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. The popularity of this approach is reflected in different countries legislation; for instance, US, EU and UK have introduced economic criteria for comparing costs and benefits of environmental policies in protecting ecosystem services. From an operational perspective, the ecosystem services framework requires ecologists to estimate how the supply of services is affected by changes in the functionality and/or the extent of ecosystems; and economists to identify how changes in the supply affect the flow of direct and indirect benefits to people. However, this approach may be simplistic when faced with the complexity of social-ecological systems. We investigated this for three different marine services: assimilative capacity of waste, coastal defense and renewable energy. We find that economic valuation could provide efficient and fair allocations in the case of assimilative capacity, but leads to social clashes between outputs generated by cost benefit analysis and citizens' expectation in the case of coastal defense. In the case of renewable energy, controversies can be generated by regulatory mechanisms that are not necessarily aligned with the interests of industry or important social groups. We conclude that there is a need to integrate perspectives arising from utilitarian allocation of resources with those involving legislation and communal values in order to reconcile conflicting interests and better sustain marine social-ecological systems.

AB  - Offering extended warranty (EW) contracts for products such as automobiles is a good source of revenue for manufactures, insurers and third party companies. However, difficulties in the modeling of product’s failure process and assessing corrective and preventive maintenance actions’ effects on the reliability of product enforce the service providers to propose limited EW contracts with simple “minimal repair at failures” servicing strategy. In this paper for a product sold with a two-dimensional warranty, we model the failure process of product, the effect of imperfect preventive maintenance (PM) and corresponding servicing cost in terms of product’s age and usage. Then, we propose a mathematical optimization model to derive optimal number and degrees of preventive repairs to minimize the EW provider’s servicing cost. We also provide some guidelines to help the EW provider to design flexible EW contracts and determine their corresponding optimal maintenance strategies. To reproduce an illustrative numerical example, we use the failure history of a commercial vehicle produced in a plant in Iran. The provided results reveal that considering proper preventive maintenance strategy during the EW period may effectively reduces the cost of EW servicing.

AB  - Development of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) experienced exciting times over the last two decades. A two-dose OCV, found efficacious through field trials, has obtained license for use in India. However, the current policy discussion revolves around ‘to use or not to use’ this vaccine covering entire population in the country, which has its own cost implications. We conducted a systematic review to address this conundrum. The disease burden and distribution, potential impact, programmatic issues, and competing priorities were kept in consideration. Peer reviewed articles and ‘Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’ data, generated by Government of India, were accessed. Our synthesis highlights that cholera burden estimates for India have been hamstrung by their extrapolation from a single incidence study conducted in Kolkata. Heterogeneity of 685 Indian districts regarding vulnerability to cholera is also obvious. Analysis of outbreak reports indicated that some settlements and sub-populations were more vulnerable to diarrhea/cholera than others. Infrastructure failure leading to contamination of drinking water and behavioral issues were of concern. Investment in safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and addressing inequity of health services pertaining to vulnerable population groups are the needs of the hour. OCV could play an important role as one of the elements in such multi-component cholera prevention effort. OCV administration through public health system in Odisha identified logistic challenges, with low uptake of the second dose at 46%, while 61% of the target population received the first dose. We identified accumulating global evidence on the advantage and efficacy of single-dose based approach, where the same OCV, as licensed in India, was used. The short-lasting nature of cholera outbreaks in India also argue in favor of such pragmatism. Failure to implement multi-component prevention strategy today runs the risk of perpetuating inequity, recurring cholera outbreaks in future, and its retinue of costs.

T2  - The Future of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Care (Part 2)
AB  - Economic and environmental sustainability are essential to maintaining delivery of high quality healthcare. Numerous medical innovations in recent times demonstrate that modern cardiovascular care is in quick and constant flux. Examples are the novel minimally-invasive interventions, improved disease management in heart failure, innovative methods in atrial fibrillation ablation or the personalized medicine approach in cardiomyopathies. Healthcare's predilection, however, for a single use oil-based plastics and metalware are unsustainable in the long run (even considering a 50year time frame, let alone 1000years). Sustainability is not an isolated competency of clinical practice, but instead transcends such seemingly disparate fields such as: finance, environment, security, resilience, staffing, efficiency, effectiveness, patient centred care and business ethics. Healthcare providers tend to be isolated in domains within hospitals such as the paediatric catherization (cath) laboratory (lab) and the operating room, with a limited understanding of the full process, complexity and broader implications of “what we do” daily and How these practices impact the environment. Consider the following simple “sustainability” questions: What are the financial costs of a routine angiogram for a child with Tetralogy of Fallot? How much waste per day is produced by the cath lab? Is it possible to use reusable instead of single use medical devices? In this paper we explore the: (a) incremental sustainability changes; (b) opportunities and barriers for sustainability initiatives within the paediatric cath lab; (c) discuss the transformational changes aimed at broader concerns about “unsustainable" cardiovascular care”; and, (d) provide a roadmap for sustainability education, training and research. Sustainable solutions must enable pediatric cardiovascular clinicians to not to make sound clinical decisions and provide safer procedures, but also address the growing economic and environmental challenges faced by today's healthcare systems.

AB  - Recent technological advances have paved the way for developing and offering advanced services for the stakeholders in the agricultural sector. A paradigm shift is underway from proprietary and monolithic tools to Internet-based, cloud hosted, open systems that will enable more effective collaboration between stakeholders. This new paradigm includes the technological support of application developers to create specialized services that will seamlessly interoperate, thus creating a sophisticated and customisable working environment for the end users. We present the implementation of an open architecture that instantiates such an approach, based on a set of domain independent software tools called “generic enablers” that have been developed in the context of the FI-WARE project. The implementation is used to validate a number of innovative concepts for the agricultural sector such as the notion of a services’ market place and the system’s adaptation to network failures. During the design and implementation phase, the system has been evaluated by end users, offering us valuable feedback. The results of the evaluation process validate the acceptance of such a system and the need of farmers to have access to sophisticated services at affordable prices. A summary of this evaluation process is also presented in this paper.

AB  - The development of recycling technologies of asphalt pavements has encouraged industry to promote the use of modifying agents (rejuvenators and/or softeners) able to soften aged bitumen. In this paper, a new concept of physicochemical rejuvenation is described, by using a reactive surfactant (dodecenyl succinic anhydride, DSA). The results obtained demonstrate that DSA addition makes a binder less stiff and viscous in the entire in-service temperature range, being more effective than a selected benchmark: engine oil. Rheological techniques also point to a notable improvement at low temperature, as modification by DSA shifts the glassy regions of the mechanical spectrum towards lower temperatures, decreasing the flexural creep stiffness and increasing the rate of creep, hence yielding binders that can withstand higher stress before cracking failure. Unlike most of rejuvenators used, which merely act as physical softeners by diluting bituminous binders with oils, FTIR data evidence the existence of chemical interactions, hinting at the attachment of DSA to polar compounds in bitumen. These new chemical species affect the degree of association and dispersion of such polar constituents, modifying the colloidal stability, which gives rise to the observed rheological behaviour. Finally, contact angle measurements show an improvement in binder wettability of a siliceous aggregate.

AB  - Data is everywhere. Both, machines and men leave a digital shadow behind, which, for some means the success or failure of their business. Enterprises strive to make the most of this scattered, diverse and ever growing data, in order to obtain information they can apply to the decision-making processes. But, apart from the known and researched technical issues of volume, variety and velocity; more essential issues have to be addressed. Namely, how does an enterprise find the analytical model it needs to obtain the information it desires? From simple regression analyses to artificial intelligence, the variety in which data can be analyzed is immense. Involving specialist and consultants is time-consuming, needs effort and is usually too expensive, especially for SMEs. This paper discusses the current options in the usage of analytics by enterprises as well as the existing challenges and elaborates recommendations for the future. Special focus is put on customer-oriented analytics by means of analytical services. In these, the building blocks of analytics are modularized in three layers: Data Interpretation & Cleansing Layer, Data Processing Layer, and Data Visualization Layer. This modularization allows building analytics in a standardized manner. Such services aim at reducing the gap between the holders of expert knowledge and the users of analytics. This is achieved by placing the attention on obtaining the desired information (choosing from a portfolio of analytics) instead of solving fundamental challenges, already addressed by the respective modules.

Originally a pioneer in the field of economic development work, FUNDES had begun to face fundamental changes. The case illustrates how the organization was able to effectively continue to fulfill its mission despite these unpredictable dynamics by implementing strategic changes based on principles of collective mindfulness. FUNDES continually monitored the impact of its services, viewing early signs of failure in the fulfillment of its mission as indications to adjust its service portfolio. Later, FUNDES successfully changed its funding structure when the donor announced that it would be ceasing investments. Strengthening its emerging focus on projects that included large enterprises, FUNDES reinvented both its service portfolio and its business model, becoming a financially self-sustaining, mission-driven and market-oriented organization.

TI  - NGOs fostering transitions towards sustainable urban sanitation in low-income countries: Insights from Transition Management and Development Studies
AU  - van Welie, Mara J.
AU  - Romijn, Henny A.
T2  - Environmental Science & Policy
AB  - Globally, 756 million people in urban areas have no access to improved sanitation, while the urban population is increasing rapidly. Providing toilets has often not been a sustainable solution because of failure to link them to the necessary service infrastructure. Resolving urban sanitation problems in low-income countries requires innovations in approaches covering infrastructure, technology, social embedding, financial mechanisms and cost recovery. This paper explores the potential challenges and contribution of NGOs in facilitating new, integrated solutions to urban sanitation problems that address the entire sanitation chain, promising better social, financial and environmental sustainability. A case study of a sanitation project initiated by a large Dutch NGO is presented, using reconstruction of project documentation and interviews with project stakeholders. The analytical framework combines elements from Transition Management (TM) with insights from process approaches to development projects and community development. The choice of the TM concept is motivated by the notion that the new NGO approaches could be conceived as efforts to initiate a sustainability transition process in urban sanitation, whereas its complementation with insights from the development studies domain answers to the need to attune a TM-based framework to participation in the socio-institutional context in low-income countries, to understand the progress of governing transition processes in informal, low-income settings. This context requires special attention for capacity-building and creation of organizational structures in poor local communities. The case study shows that this entailed specialised groundwork, with which the NGO laid a crucial foundation that enabled transition frontrunners to act. Simultaneously, this focus on bottom-up empowerment created challenges for the NGO in effectively involving the right frontrunner actors who could put pressure on incumbent societal structures and institutions. We conclude that transitions in low-income contexts require extra attention to local empowerment and institution building to lay the required foundations for a locally rooted transition process. Development NGOs like the one in our case study have the skills to do this, but need to learn how to combine these with additional necessary competences to facilitate systemic change.

T2  - Journal of Transport Geography
AB  - The analysis of market structure and concentration measures for the Intermodal Freight Transport (IFT) market is important to avoid market failure and to find the areas for policy making to promote IFT market share. This analysis can be performed for separate segments, for example, the market for transshipment service or the market for main-haulage service. However, due to the multistage characteristic of IFT service, the segmental analysis gives an incomplete view of the IFT market at the network level. In a previous paper (Saeedi et al., 2017), we present the Intermodal Freight Transport Market Structure (IFTMS) model to conduct a network-based study of the IFTMS in which distinctive actors (i.e., pre/post haulage operators, terminals, rail/barge operators, transport chains, and corridors) are competing at different levels inside distinctive markets to deliver an integrated IFT service. There are two main challenges in the application of IFTMS model in real cases, for example, the European IFT network. First, the definition of the geographical and spatial border of the transshipment market areas is needed to determine which actors are potentially competing for a specific service demand. The second challenge is the lack of disaggregated data and the consistency of existing data in nodes (i.e., the transshipment areas) and links (i.e., the rail and barge operators). To cope with these challenges, we develop a four-step methodology in which a model-based approach is used to define the geographic boundaries of the transshipment submarkets and provide detailed and consistent data for market analysis. We also apply the IFTMS model to study the market structure of European intermodal network. Our analysis shows that the majority of transshipment markets as well as main-haulage markets are highly concentrated markets. The corridor markets – which include the IFT chains – are unconcentrated markets. Furthermore, the majority of corridors in the European Union are inside highly concentrated origin-destination markets.

AB  - The farm animal veterinary profession in the UK has faced a number of challenges in recent decades related to the withdrawal of government funding and a contraction of the agricultural sector. They have come under pressure to respond by developing skills and focusing on disease prevention advisory services. However, this puts veterinarians in competition with other providers of these services, and moves in this direction have only been partial. Failure to respond to these challenges puts the veterinary profession at risk of de-professionalisation—a loss of their monopoly over knowledge, an erosion of client beliefs in their service ethos and a loss of work autonomy. This paper explores how farm animal veterinarians in England perceive these challenges and are responding to them. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were carried out with 28 veterinarians from Royal College of Veterinary Surgeon farm accredited practices. Veterinarians were chosen from high, medium and low density cattle farming regions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and themes identified through the constant comparison method. The majority of respondents recognised the challenges facing the veterinary profession. Most believed their role had changed, moving towards that of a disease prevention adviser who was part of the farm management team. In terms of maintaining and redefining their professional status, farm animal veterinarians do have a defined body of knowledge and the ability to develop trusting relationships with clients, which enhances their competitiveness. However, while they recognise the changes and challenges, moves towards a disease prevention advisory model have only been partial. There seem to be little effort towards using Farm accreditation status or other strategies to promote their services. They do not appear to be finding effective strategies for putting their knowledge on disease prevention into practice. Disease prevention appears to be delivered on farm on an ad hoc basis, they are not promoting their disease prevention services to farmers effectively or using their professional position to stave off competition. Farm animals veterinarians will need to realign their veterinary expertise to the demands of the market, work together rather than in competition, improve their skills in preventive medicine, consolidate information given by non-veterinary advisors, develop new business models appropriate to their services and develop entrepreneurial skills to demonstrate their market value if they are to avoid becoming marginalised.

AB  - Performance-Based Logistics (PBL) is becoming a dominant logistics support strategy, especially in the defense industry. PBL contracts are designed to serve the customer’s key performance measures, while the traditional contracts for after-sales services, such as Fixed-price (FP) and Cost-plus (C+), only provide insurance or incentive. In this research, we develop an inventory model for a repairable parts system operating under a PBL contract. We model the closed-loop inventory system as an M/M/m queue in which component failures are Poisson distributed and the repair times at the service facility are exponential. Our model provides the supplier and the customer increased flexibility in achieving target availability. Analysis of key parameters suggests that to improve the availability of the system with repairable spare parts, the supplier should work to improve the components reliability and efficiency of repair facility, rather than the base stock level, which has minimal impact on system availability.

AB  - Objective
To measure immunization coverage among children aged 12–23 months in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and to assess if and why there are differences between hard-to-reach and more accessible communities.
Methods
WHO cluster sampling methodology was employed to measure immunization coverage in PNG's four regions. Survey data were re-analyzed according to a local assessment of geographical accessibility indicated by census unit type: urban, rural and hard-to-reach. Census units were designated as hard-to-reach if they were five or more kilometres from a health centre.
Findings
Nationwide coverage for most antigens falls below the national target of 80% although there are regional differences with Islands performing the best. Late doses are a major concern: just 4% were fully immunized with valid (“on time”) doses by 1 year of age. Coverage was lower in both rural and remote communities: at 6 months 48% of children from urban units had received three valid doses of DTP-3 but only 16% in rural areas and 13% in hard-to-reach communities. Reasons for failure to immunize varied: 21% of mothers said their child was not immunized because distance, travel conditions or cost of transportation prevented access to local health centres; 27% cited a lack of knowledge or misconceptions about immunization; while 29% believed it was because of an issue with the health system.
Conclusions
Throughout PNG there is an urgent need to increase immunization coverage and to ensure that children are immunized on time according to the schedule. Both coverage and timeliness of doses are worse for children living in hard-to-reach and rural areas. Achieving national immunization targets requires improvements in health service delivery, including outreach, especially for remote and rural communities, as well as greater community education and social mobilisation in support of immunization services.

AB  - Refrigeration containers experiences ambient temperatures ranging from — 25° C to 40° C and humidities that fluctuate just as much. Furthermore the maintenance engineers despite doing their best, only apply hot-fixes to the systems when they’re serviced. This work addresses the idea of detecting errors on the refrigeration system, by using all available sensory input. The data is then applied to construct an estimator of the sample-distribution, which in turn can be used to determine if a sample can be classified as a failure or not. The approach builds on that of Lasserre and Pauwels (2016), but the extension out-performs the original, across all log-files the system is tested on. In conclusion, the method derived throughout this paper, is indeed viable for fault detection on refrigeration containers.

T2  - Conference on ENTERprise Information Systems/International Conference on Project MANagement/Conference on Health and Social Care Information Systems and Technologies, CENTERIS/ProjMAN / HCist 2015 October 7-9, 2015
AB  - The growth of cities in the 21st century has put more pressure on resources and conditions of urban life. There are several reasons why the health-care industry is the focus of this investigation. For instance, in the UK various studies point to the lack of failure of basic quality control procedures and misalignment between customer needs and provider services and duplication of logistics practices. The development of smart cities and big data present unprecedented challenges and opportunities for operations managers; they need to develop new tools and techniques for network planning and control. Our paper aims to make a contribution to big data and city operations theory by exploring how big data can lead to improvements in transport capacity sharing. We explore using Markov models the integration of big data with future city (health-care) transport sharing. A mathematical model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. The results from our analysis of 13 different sharing/demand scenarios are presented. A key finding is that the probability for system failure and performance variance tends to be highest in a scenario of high demand/zero sharing.

TI  - Mathematical modeling and Bayesian estimation for error-prone retail shelf audits
AU  - Chuang, Howard Hao-Chun
T2  - Decision Support Systems
AB  - Prevalent execution errors such as out-of-stock, inventory record inaccuracy, and product misplacement jeopardize retail performance by causing low on-shelf availability, which discourages not only retailers who have lost sales but also manufacturers who have worked hard to deliver goods into retail stores. Thus, external service companies are hired by manufacturers to conduct manual inspection regularly. Motivated by the practical need of shelf audit service providers, we use a general cost structure to develop a decision support model for periodic inspection. Some qualitative insights about the intricate relationships among inspection efficacy, cost factors, failure rate of shelf inventory integrity, and optimal decisions are derived from analytics assuming risk-neutrality. From simulation experiments we also find that managers' risk preferences have non-trivial impacts on optimal decisions. Based on a total cost standpoint high-quality inspection is predominantly preferred regardless of the level of risk aversion. Finally, we propose a Bayesian statistical model and a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate model parameters such that managers can make empirically informed decisions. Our major contribution lies in developing a mathematical model that is practically applicable and proposing a Bayesian estimation approach to rationalize unobservable model parameters, which are influential to optimal decisions but often arbitrarily assumed by decision makers.

The AR&M modelling activity was completed using the Monte Carlo simulation tool SPAR, produced by Clockwork Solutions. SPAR is a flexible software tool which allowed the development of models to include the end-to-end Skynet 5 system, its complex logistic support network, and the calculation of bespoke Service availability metrics. The development of this end-to-end type approach has provided a number of benefits, including: highlighting potential areas of weakness in the support solution; understanding the impact on global AR&M performance; and validation of consolidated spares recommendations and identification of areas with insufficient spares, at multiple levels of support (as many as the user requires). Furthermore it has the ability to demonstrate the impact of management system downtime; which would not directly impact the availability of the system, but may delay the identification (and hence repair time) of a co-incident failure.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - This article contributes to the understanding of the current transformation of the energy industry in Europe and the interplay between greening policies and digital technological innovation. It shows how, since the financial crisis, core players in the European energy industry ended up in a dualist limbo, between conventional and emerging business models. It documents how strategies and business models that delivered extraordinary financial performance in the first decade of the 21st century often failed dramatically after the 2008 financial crisis. Yet it finds that incumbents with 1) a greener energy mix, 2) smaller scale and, quite naturally, 3) better financial performance fared better than others The study explores the emergence of new business models and finds that most of the emerging business models circle around the customer interface where digital solutions allow more flexible interplay between consumption and production of energy, and/or between several service alternatives to fulfill basic needs for customer home comfort. The article also discusses important policy implications: For competition policy, it indicates a shift from challenges of scale and scope towards challenges of regulating networks and dominant platforms. Furthermore, it highlights new policy dilemmas concerning balancing and energy storage to accommodate intermittent supply from renewables.

TI  - The cost for meeting SLA dependability requirements; implications for customers and providers
AU  - Følstad, Eirik L.
AU  - Helvik, Bjarne E.
T2  - Reliability Engineering & System Safety
AB  - A Service Level Agreement (SLA) describes the service, the service-level objectives (SLOs), the price the customer should pay and the compensation if the SLOs are not met. There is a trade-off for the provider between the costs for improving the deployed service quality vs. probability of paying compensation. We propose how to estimate the provider׳s optimal service deployment. We show that the optimal deployed service quality is dependent on the SLOs, deployment cost, compensation and observation interval. A service deployment based on cost optimization results in targeted dependability objective values that are significantly better than stated in the SLOs. The proposed approach provides valuable insight for an aggregator, who buys services from other providers, to negotiate adequate SLOs, price and compensation from the providers to make a valuable offer for its own customers.

T2  - Computers & Electrical Engineering
AB  - Effective and reliable cloud services depend on the quality of service provided by large-scale data centers, and data center equipment reliability issues can cause significant data and financial loss to cloud service clients. Corrective maintenance is a reactive approach that only corrects problems once they occur, resulting in unwanted downtime, while preventative maintenance relies on replacing equipment which may yet still have considerable effective operating lifetime, thus raising maintenance costs. In contrast, predictive maintenance can potentially predict equipment failure in advance, thus reducing unplanned downtime and extending equipment lifetimes, thus reducing maintenance costs while increasing system reliability. This research aims to develop a real-time predictive maintenance system, HDPass, based on Apache Spark for the detection of imminent hard disk drive (HDD) failures in data centers.

T2  - The 2nd International Conference "Green Cities - Green Logistics for Greener Cities", 2-3 March 2016, Szczecin, Poland
AB  - With the increase of companies’ sustainable turnover, most companies are thinking about creating a distribution center. The consumers should obtain the necessary quality and quantity level of the goods at the right time in the right place, etc., from a reliable supplier, with a sufficient level of service and a minimum level of total costs. Failure to comply with any of these requirements can lead to loss of customers or market share. The research study of the Ukrainian distribution system was made on the example of one of the national companies which sells building materials. The article defines irregularity in functioning of existing distribution channels. At the same time, the authors determine inefficiency of various distribution channels used by the participants of the retailers’ network in one region. To solve this problem, combining several material flows has been proposed. Serving clients together allows avoiding seasonality and makes goods volumes more sustainable. In this case, the use of the distribution center is rational. Applying a DC in customers consolidation areas allows increasing productivity and efficiency of the distribution system and improving logistics indicators. Obtained results are based on: scientific and practical analysis of irregular services of material flows; integrated and system approaches to data processing; an experimental method for implementing the distribution center in the distribution system; methods of project analysis evaluating the distribution system effectiveness.

TI  - Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks
AU  - Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis
T2  - FinTech – Impact on Consumers, Banking and Regulatory Policy
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop an insight and review the effect of FinTech development against the broader environment in financial technology. We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.11We thank two anonymous referees for their very thoughtful and constructing comments who took a keen interest in reviewing our research and in this way contributed materially to the development of the paper. All other omissions and/or errors remain our own.

TI  - The antecedents of customer satisfaction and its link to complaint intentions in online shopping: An integration of justice, technology, and trust
AU  - Wu, Ing-Long
T2  - International Journal of Information Management
AB  - Complaint behaviors are critical to maintaining customer loyalty in an online market. They provide insight into the customer's experience of service failure and help to redress the failures. Previous studies have shown the importance of customer satisfaction as a mediator for complaint intentions. It is important to examine the antecedents of customer satisfaction and its link to complaint intentions. Online shoppers are both buyers of products/services and users of web-based systems. Trust also plays a critical role in forming a psychological state with positive or negative feelings toward e-vendors. In this context, there are three major concerns: justice, technology and trust. This study proposes a research model to combine these issues, in order to investigate complaint intentions. Data were collected from an online survey wherein subjects were encouraged to reflect on recent service failure experiences. The results from testing a structural equation model indicate that distributive and interactional justice contribute significantly to customer satisfaction and, in turn, to complaint intentions, but procedural justice does not. Technology-based features and trust are also important in determining the two target variables. The implications for managers and scholars are also discussed.

T2  - Proceedings of the 5th International Conference in Through-life Engineering Services Cranfield University, 1st and 2nd November 2016
AB  - Outcome-based contracts that pay for effectiveness and penalize performance shortcomings have been introduced to incentivize cost reduction efforts on the contractor side of product service systems (PSSs). Outcome-based contracting concepts are being used for PSS acquisitions in healthcare, energy, military systems and infrastructure. These contracts allow customers to pay only for the specific outcomes achieved (e.g., availability) rather than the workmanship and materials delivered. Given the rise in interest in outcome-based contracts, it is incumbent upon the through-life engineering services (TES) community to determine how to design systems (including designing the sustainment of systems) to operate under these contract mechanisms, and to ultimately coordinate the system design with the design of the contract terms. Furthermore, sustainment decisions made under outcome-based contracts must target the optimum action for the population of systems managed under the contract, rather than the optimum action for an individual system. Today, outcome-based contract design is always performed separate from the engineering and TES design processes, and provided as a requirement to the design process, an approach that creates significant risks for all parties. For systems managed under outcome-based contracts, contract failure may mean significant money is spent by the customer (potentially the public) for either no outcome or inadequate outcome, or result in the contractor being driven out of business, which can lead to disaster for both parties.

AB  - Urban dwellers are increasingly vulnerable to failures of technological systems that supply them with goods and services. Extant techniques for the analysis of those technological systems, although valuable, do not adequately quantify particular vulnerabilities. This study explores the significance of weaknesses within technological systems and proposes a metric of “exposure”, which is shown to represent the vulnerability contributed by the technological system to the end-user. The measure thus contributes to the theory and practice of vulnerability reduction. The results suggest specific and general conclusions.

TI  - Mitigation of Hardware Trojan based Denial-of-Service attack for secure NoCs
AU  - Boraten, Travis
AU  - Kodi, Avinash
T2  - Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing
AB  - As Multiprocessor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) continue to scale, security for Network-on-Chips (NoCs) is a growing concern as rogue agents threaten to infringe on the hardware’s trust and maliciously implant Hardware Trojans (HTs) to undermine their reliability. The trustworthiness of MPSoCs will rely on our ability to detect Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats posed by the HTs and mitigate HTs in a compromised NoC to permit graceful network degradation. In this paper, we propose a new light-weight target-activated sequential payload (TASP) HT model that performs packet inspection and injects faults to create a new type of DoS attack. Faults injected are used to trigger a response from error correction code (ECC) schemes and cause repeated retransmission to starve network resources and create deadlocks capable of rendering single-application to full chip failures. To circumvent the threat of HTs, we propose a heuristic threat detection model to classify faults and discover HTs within compromised links. To prevent further disruption, we propose several switch-to-switch link obfuscation methods to avoid triggering of HTs in an effort to continue using links instead of rerouting packets with minimal overhead (1–3 cycles). To sustain data integrity over a compromised link, we propose an optimized implementation of algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes to detect any fault injection in targeted flits. Our proposed modifications complement existing fault detection and obfuscation methods and only add 2% in area overhead and 6% in excess power consumption in the NoC micro-architecture.

TI  - A critical mass analysis of community-based financing of water services in rural Kenya
AU  - Foster, Tim
T2  - Water Resources and Rural Development
AB  - Critical mass dynamics have been widely used to explain the initiation and spread of collective behaviours, from protests and political representation, through to vaccinations and adoption of new technologies. For the first time, this study applies critical mass theory to community waterpoint financial contributions in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The presence of critical mass points, cooperative equilibria and self-reinforcing growth dynamics is empirically evaluated through assessment of multi-decadal waterpoint financial records from rural Kenya, comprising 43,020 household payments over a 26 year period. An examination of month-to-month changes in user contribution rates and financial record continuity suggests contribution levels remain relatively stable once more than 60% of water users are paying. Revenue collection systems tend to become unstable and are prone to collapse during the wet season if user contributions drop below a 60% threshold, but appear to be more resilient in dry season with evidence of self-reinforcing growth dynamics when 40–60% of users contribute. Results reveal that some communities are able to sustain their waterpoint over a long period of time even if a moderate proportion of users do not contribute financially. The analysis also highlights the influence of climate patterns on community-based financing, and the fragility of collective behaviours during wetter periods. Further investigation is needed to assess what dynamics emerge in a more representative sample of waterpoints, particularly in the first few years after installation when failures commonly occur.

TI  - Last time buy decisions for products sold under warranty
AU  - van der Heijden, Matthieu
AU  - Iskandar, Bermawi P.
T2  - European Journal of Operational Research
AB  - Manufacturers supplying products under warranty need a strategy to deal with failures during the warranty period: repair the product or replace it by a new one, depending on e.g. age and/or usage of the failed product. An (implicit) assumption in virtually all models is that new products to replace the failed ones are immediately available at given replacement costs. Because of the short life cycles of many products, manufacturing may be discontinued before the end of the warranty period. At that point in time, the supplier has to decide how many products to put on the shelf to replace failed products under warranty that will be returned from the field (the last time buy decision). This is a trade-off between product availability for replacement and costs of product obsolescence. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of repair-replacement decisions and the last time buy quantity for products sold under warranty. We develop approximations to estimate the total relevant costs and service levels for this problem, and show that we can easily find near-optimal last time buy quantities using a numerical search. Comparison to discrete event simulation results shows an excellent performance of our methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND
This article provides consensus suggestions for expanding critical care surge capacity and extension of critical care service capabilities in disasters or pandemics. It focuses on the principles and frameworks for expansion of intensive care services in hospitals in the developed world. A companion article addresses surge logistics, those elements that provide the capability to deliver mass critical care in disaster events. The suggestions in this article are important for all who are involved in large-scale disasters or pandemics with injured or critically ill multiple patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials.
METHODS
The Surge Capacity topic panel developed 23 key questions focused on the following domains: systems issues; equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals; staffing; and informatics. Literature searches were conducted to identify evidence on which to base key suggestions. Most reports were small scale, were observational, or used flawed modeling; hence, the level of evidence on which to base recommendations was poor and did not permit the development of evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. Suggestions from the previous task force were also included for validation by the expert panel.
RESULTS
This article presents 10 suggestions pertaining to the principles that should guide surge capacity and capability planning for mass critical care, including the role of critical care in disaster planning; the surge continuum; targets of surge response; situational awareness and information sharing; mitigating the impact on critical care; planning for the care of special populations; and service deescalation/cessation (also considered as engineered failure).
CONCLUSIONS
Future reports on critical care surge should emphasize population-based outcomes as well as logistical details. Planning should be based on the projected number of critically ill or injured patients resulting from specific scenarios. This should include a consideration of ICU patient care requirements over time and must factor in resource constraints that may limit the ability to provide care. Standard ICU management forms and patient data forms to assess ICU surge capacity impacts should be created and used in disaster events.

T2  - Engineering Failure Analysis
AB  - The welding of service-exposed, aged Heat Resistant Nickel-Base alloys is notorious in industry for being extremely difficult. There is an extremely high propensity for cracking in the heat affected zone of the weld joint. During a Reformer's service and/or periodic offline inspections, it may be determined that repairs are necessary and as such sections of the tube are replaced. However, attempts to weld are often hindered by the manifestation of cracks adjacent to the weld during or immediately after the welding process. In this investigation, service-exposed aged reformer tube material (HP-Mod.Nb or 25Cr/35Ni/1Nb/0.4C) sections were welded using the current procedures and parameters used in practice and the resultant effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties evaluated. Characteristic cracking typical to that observed in field welds was experienced. The observed cracks were subjected to a failure analysis to identify the responsible damage mechanism. It was found that the root cause of the cracking was due to Creep Embrittlement. Modification of the existing weld procedure can serve to reduce the effects of this damage mechanism.

T2  - Analyzing the Impacts of Advanced Information Technologies on Business Operations
AB  - Mobile-enabled location-based services are generating a huge amount of customer checkin data every day. It is vital to understand how small businesses, like restaurants, use this real-time data to make better-informed business operation decisions in this mobile marketing era. Using data collected from Foursquare, a leading location-based service provider, and Yelp, we aim to find out the predictive power of customer checkins on business failure of restaurants in New York City by using several predictive modeling techniques, such as Neural Network, Logit model and K-nearest neighbor. Our findings are encouraging. The customer checkin data from both a focal restaurant and its neighbors have shown strong predictive power on business failure. Compared to the baseline model in which we only use business characteristic variables to predict failure, incorporating the checkin data captured from location-based services gives a remarkable improvement on predictive accuracy. Our findings provide the foundation for future studies on the predictive power of information obtained from location-based services on business operations.

TI  - Success and failure in the political economy of solar electrification: Lessons from World Bank Solar Home System (SHS) projects in Sri Lanka and Indonesia
AU  - Sovacool, Benjamin K.
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - This study contrasts two national solar home system (SHS) programs that relied on the same World Bank approach, but reached dramatically different results. The Energy Services Delivery Project (ESDP) in Sri Lanka was an exemplary renewable energy access program, successfully installing 21,000 off-grid SHSs alongside grid-connected mini-hydro capacity and off-grid village hydroelectric systems. It reached all of its targets ahead of schedule and below cost. By contrast, the Indonesia Solar Home System Project (ISHSP), which ran from 1997 to 2003, sought to reach one million rural Indonesians through the sales and installation of 200,000 SHSs. However, by project closing in 2003, less than five percent of the original sales target, or only 8054 units, had been installed. The ESDP and ISHSP were the World Bank's first foray into a “market-based renewable energy services provision model.” Based on original research interviews and field observation, the article finds that contrasting the two programs—one a success, the other a failure—offers lessons for energy and development practitioners, namely that effective programs are those that select appropriate technology, often with input from households themselves; they promote community participation and ownership; and they have robust marketing, demonstration, and promotion activities.

AB  - This paper reviews the trends in Earth observation (EO) and the possible impacts on markets of the new initiatives, launched either by existing providers of EO data or by new players, privately funded. After a presentation of the existing models, the paper discusses the new approaches, addressing both commercial and institutional markets. New concepts for the very high resolution markets, in Europe and in the US, are the main focus of this analysis. Two complementary perspectives are summarised: on the one hand, the type of system and its operational performance and, on the other, the related business models, concepts of operation and ownership schemes. Until now, Earth observation systems for the most critical institutional needs are mainly dedicated assets owned and operated by governments or public organisations, often at national level. Even in the case of dual use missions, the governmental and commercial operations are in general fully segregated for the very high resolution satellites. Recent evolutions could affect this paradigm. Firstly, the increased performance of commercial satellites has a high degree of convergence with defence needs: 25–30cm resolution is now the benchmark or at least a very short term target for commercial missions. The second evolution is the development of hybrid procurement schemes, combining proprietary missions and data buy framework contracts, partly triggered by the budgetary constraints of public customers, some failures in the execution of large spy satellites contracts and by the willingness to foster the competitiveness of industry on the export market. New space is another trend, which is more disruptive. This trend begun in the Silicon Valley and spread worldwide, arousing our expectations, sometimes excessively. This new model involves not only start-ups but also big web actors with substantial investment capacity. Both aim to transforming space into a commodity, taking benefit from the convergence between Information technology and EO. Beside the massive constellations for broadband Internet access, some initiatives have been launched for Earth observation markets, targeting high resolution and high revisit. Last but not least, more and more countries, the newcomers, invest in their own EO capacity, confirming the soft power dimension of space but also opening new opportunities for international or regional cooperation. As many unpredictable events may occur, even in a short time frame, the last part of the paper has a prospective dimension. Based on market trends and industrial stakes, it discusses the realism and likelihood of possible scenarios and identifies their impacts on the EO landscape and the main stakeholders involved, in particular in Europe: –The governmental and institutional actors, using Earth observation data for their operational missions, with an evolving balance between sovereign assets and external services.–The commercial operators of very high resolution satellites, with the new market opportunities and the possible emergence of worldwide champions.–The satellite manufacturers and their competitiveness.–The role of nations and space agencies, including the non-dependence or national sovereignty and international cooperation dimensions. Based on the comparison of three “radical” scenarios, the conclusion shows that there are opportunities for service providers and satellite manufacturers. Even without clear answer to the future industrial, technical and political structure of EO systems, relevant indicators to be monitored during the next three-five years are identified. The last section focuses on Europe and the role of institutions in order to support European champions and small and medium companies in the new worldwide competition.

AU  - Booman, J.
AU  - González, M.O.

T2  - Engineering Failure Analysis
AB  - The causes of recent fires in hydrocarbon heaters are discussed in this paper. In particular, failures are chosen for which root causes involve trying to get around existing operational shortcomings by making changes to control, instead of carrying out a proper Root Cause Analysis to identify actual causes of deficiencies. In one case, the heater would extinguish due to the poor characteristics of fuel gas. A restart routine was devised, in which previous purging was avoided. In the other case, turning off one burner would turn off the remaining. Instead of addressing the reason why a burner would turn off, the operator modified gas inlet control so that the remaining burners would remain on. Details are given of the chain of events that led to these failures. It is concluded that heaters should be carefully chosen or designed to meet specific operation requirements. Modifications should be avoided whenever possible and carefully planned, in association with the manufacturer when they are unavoidable. In every case, safety systems should be in accordance with modern safety standards.

T2  - Tourism Management
AB  - In the past two decades, community involvement in local policy-making has gained increasing attention as an alternative approach to rural development in the European Union (EU), particularly in the context of the complementary sectors of agriculture such as tourism. Although there is a wide range of integrated approaches to tourism development in rural areas identified in the literature, the event-based approach has not been at the centre of attention so far. This paper aims to fill this gap and reports on the collaborative capacity building of the LEADER11A French acronym derived from ‘Liaison Entre Actions de Développement de l’Économie Rurale’, meaning ‘Links between the rural economy and development actions’. Local Action Groups (LAGs) for rural tourism promotion in the context of an innovative, national-level event, the ‘Hungarian Rural Tourism Days’. A mixed-method approach was applied to explore and compare the supply-side views on the successes and failures of the event planning and organisation process and to derive key success factors of the event-based approach to Integrated Rural Tourism (IRT). The results provided evidence on the consequences of the failure to integrate local concerns into the event organisation process and highlighted the critical role of the intermediary management in establishing trust relationships with the rural service providers. Furthermore, it is argued that the major challenge of the event-based approach to IRT rests in the capacity of the stakeholders to collectively plan and implement a marketing strategy at the local level.

T2  - Accident Analysis & Prevention
AB  - Failure to conduct periodic fixed-time-to (or scheduled) maintenance on off-highway plant and equipment represents a significant health and safety hazard and major litigation risk for utility contractors completing service excavation and reinstatement works on public highways. Mini-excavators are a ubiquitous mobile plant item used for such tasks and have recently been responsible for several major injuries and fatalities involving workers and members of the public in the United Kingdom (UK). The research utilises the method of triangulation to examine the maintenance practices of utility contractors in the UK. Findings from the research reveal that a combination of prevailing market forces and internal ‘company’ pressures have inadvertently removed knowledgeable and trained operators, site foremen and managerial supervisors from hands-on maintenance inspections. Rather, ‘virtual’ maintenance protocols and procedures are adopted by head office but rarely fully implemented on-site. The research concludes with pragmatic recommendations and direction for future research.

AB  - The modern economy is based not only on capital and human resources, but above all on information that enterprises possess. The right information at the right time may determine the development and strong competitive position of an enterprise on the market, whereas lack of such information may even lead to its failure. A properly developed e-business strategy and tools that are well suited for the specificity of this type of business and appropriately used have a positive impact on an enterprise's success. The aim of the paper is to indicate the existing, modern tools used in e-business in the aspect of increasing the coverage and sales of the different products and services, with special reference to recognition of a specific brand. The authors attempt to present business model solutions of a selected service offered by an e-business which is a Polish leader in e-shop software, as well as resources of good practices defining how to act to provide services in an optimal way using IT communication.

AB  - This case study examines the dynamics of the mobile instant messenger (MIM) market in Korea. MIMs have been disrupting traditional mobile communication services such as voice, SMS, and media content. In response to MIMs, Korean Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) jointly launched a standards-based messenger service called Joyn, which ultimately performed poorly. Focusing on Joyn, this study analyses the changing status of MNOs and their counter-strategies against MIMs in the context of the turbulent mobile services market. For the analysis, we use a co-evolutionary framework encompassing technological, market, and regulatory domains and apply a platform competition perspective. The case of the failure of Joyn has implications for MNOs and their business models/ecosystems not only in Korea but also in other parts of the world.

AU  - Pitilakis, K.

AU  - Selva, J.
T2  - Transport Research Arena TRA2016
AB  - Transportation infrastructures are complex systems of various connected components like bridges, roads, tunnels, embankments, retaining walls in case of a highway system or wharfs, cranes, buildings, utility systems in case of port facilities. Due to their spatial extent, they are exposed to variable natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunami or landslides. Experience from past disastrous events shows that transportation infrastructures are quite vulnerable due to the lack of redundancy, the lengthy repair time, the rerouting difficulties or the cascading failures and interdependencies. Their damage could be greatly disruptive in terms of safety of life, business disruption, access to emergency services and key lifelines utilities, rescue operations and socio-economic impacts. Therefore, in terms of resilience it is important to recognize and quantify the risks and global losses associated to damages of transportation systems and to establish efficient risk mitigation strategies. These include, among others, enhancement of emergency preparedness, strengthening of existing structures and improvement of the recovery planning. Herein an integrated framework for the probabilistic systemic vulnerability and risk assessment of transportation and utility networks is presented, based on the achievements of the recently completed EC project SYNER-G (www.syner-g.eu) and the ongoing EC project STREST (www.strest-eu.org). The infrastructure is modeled according to a detailed taxonomy. The framework encompasses in an integrated fashion all aspects in the chain, from regional hazard to fragility assessment of components to the socio-economic impacts of a natural disaster, accounting for relevant uncertainties within an efficient quantitative simulation scheme, and modeling interactions between multiple component systems in the taxonomy. Selected Performance Indicators (PIs) are calculated for each network based on the estimated damages and functionality losses of the different components under the given hazards. The methodology and tools are demonstrated through case studies in the road network and the harbor of Thessaloniki city, Greece, under seismic hazard and associated geotechnical hazards (i.e. soil liquefaction). The applications include assessments of systems’ performance considering the spatial seismic hazard with correlation of ground motion intensities, the vulnerability of the network components, and the effect of interactions within the system, as well as, between components of different systems. In particular, road disruptions can be caused due to direct damage of road segments and bridges, as well as building and overpass collapses. Harbor operations can be disturbed due to failures of waterfront structures and cargo handling equipment, as well as disruptions to the electric power supply and building collapses. The systemic risk for the road network and harbor is calculated, specifically focusing on the short-term impact of seismic events (just after the earthquake) and the risk curves (i.e. mean annual rates of exceedance for loss in performance of the infrastructures) are provided. The significant elements for the functionality of each system are defined through correlation factors to the system PIs. Such results can contribute to the decision-making regarding the enhancement of existing and the robust development of new infrastructures in the frame of safety and resiliency.

AU  - Tripathi, Anu

T2  - Mechanics of Materials
AB  - High density polyethylene (HDPE) has been widely used in pipe systems for water delivery. Over the course of service, chlorine diffuses into HDPE and causes changes in the material morphology. This process has a significant influence on the deformation and failure mechanisms of HDPE. It has been demonstrated that the failure of HDPE exhibits a ductile-to-brittle transition as the corrosion level increases. Capturing this transition in the material failure mode is essential for predicting the long-term behavior of HDPE structures exposed to a chlorinated environment. In this study, a morphology based constitutive model of HDPE is developed. The model takes into account several essential deformation and failure mechanisms, which include viscoplastic deformation due to intermolecular resistance and homogeneous void growth in the crystalline and amorphous phases, as well as entangled network resistance and craze damage in the amorphous phase. The constitutive parameters are explicitly related to the molecular weight, which varies with the corrosion level. The proposed model is calibrated using uniaxial tensile tests on HDPE samples performed at different deformation rates, crystallinities, and corrosion levels. The model is then used to simulate the mechanical behavior of double-edge notched tension specimens exposed to different corrosion levels. It is shown that the model is capable of capturing the rate-dependent elasto-viscoplastic behavior of HDPE under the unexposed condition as well as the brittle failure behavior after exposure to a highly corrosive environment.

T2  - Long-distance passenger transport market
AB  - Over the last few years there has been considerable interest in research into open-access passenger rail competition in Europe. However, the competition that existed in long-distance services in Poland between 2009 and 2015 has yet to be analysed. Surprisingly, there was fierce market rivalry between two state-owned enterprises answering to different levels of government: PKP Intercity (the central-government-run incumbent) and Przewozy Regionalne (a challenger owned by regional authorities). In comparison with the experience of other countries, this challenge was exceptional in terms of territorial reach and acquired market share (33%). In the polycentric Polish network, the challenger's services (branded under the name of Interregio) not only served up to 62% of all possible direct connections between the largest Polish cities, but also reached into more peripheral regional centres. Interestingly, we found no evidence of responsive price cutting in regular fares. In order to counteract aggressive low-cost entry, the incumbent opted for a differentiation strategy combined with a strategic use of political action. We found that although the incumbent's strategic behaviour did indeed contribute to the challenger's withdrawal from the market in 2015, its failure was mainly the result of a departure from the principal source of competitive advantage.

AB  - Growth in e-commerce has led to increasing use of light goods vehicles for parcel deliveries in urban areas. This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.

AU  - Buldeo Rai, Heleen
AU  - Verlinde, Sara
AU  - Macharis, Cathy
T2  - Research in Transportation Economics
AB  - The number of consumers that make online purchases is growing, together with the frequency in which these purchases are made. This change in consumer behaviour revitalised the practice of home delivery. Consumers prefer their homes in favour of alternative locations, despite the fair chance that they are not present at the time of delivery. The result is delivery failure, which creates unnecessary costs for logistics service providers and retailers, inconveniences for consumers and an additional burden to the environment. Smart lock systems are presented as a promising solution, as they enable access to delivery couriers by means of dedicated digital keys, even when no one is at home to receive the order. Smart locks’ technical feasibility has been demonstrated, yet consumer acceptance is the main obstacle in implementation. To this end, we organised six focus group discussions with 49 e-consumers. Findings suggest that consumers are reluctant to adopt smart lock systems, mainly because of security concerns. Suggested solutions to alleviate the obstacles include improving courier information, limiting courier access and enhancing professional support. The research contributes to the theoretical knowledge pool of efficiency-improving parcel delivery developments and provides insight into consumer acceptance of a delivery innovation that has the potential to reduce costs and increase efficiency, sustainability and receiver satisfaction.

AB  - This paper examines the role of industrial policy in providing incentives for resource-based industrialization and overcoming market obstacles in the development of local suppliers in extractive sectors. More particularly, this study examines and compares local content outcomes and strategies in Malaysia’s petroleum sector and in Chile’s copper sector The Malaysian experience shows that several market barriers can be overcome by targeted policies and infant industry protection to increase R&D, accumulate skills and capabilities. In contrast, in Chile, the development of internationally competitive local suppliers has been slowed down by market bottlenecks and the lack of public incentives for innovation, skilled human capital accumulation, and learning by doing Beyond unsustainable protectionist approaches focused on short-term goals such as local content quotas, this study reveals that sustainable local content policies require capacity building programme (through intra-industry dialogue to share key information on quality requirements, R&D and specialized human capital accumulation) in order to gradually build long-term competitiveness. The gradual accumulation of technology and skills through learning by doing enables to develop the scale and capacity of local firms to meet the demand for increasingly sophisticated inputs and services in extractive activities, as well as develop transversal capabilities that can serve other sectors.

T2  - Habitat International
AB  - This article builds on earlier work that examined waste processing options on the island of Bali, which can be seen as a useful “laboratory” for the study of solid waste management (SWM) problems and solutions in tropical Asia. The research reported here examines the challenges of waste collection, the component of SWM systems where public awareness and household waste management begin, but which are often a weak link in waste management chains. Moreover, it focuses on small towns and the specific problems they face, which are different from those in large cities that usually receive more political (and scientific) attention. The article consists of ethnographic accounts of waste collection and disposal initiatives in several small towns on the island, intended to cast light on the complex local political, economic and other socio-cultural realities that ultimately determine the success or failure of waste collection as a public utility service. Our evidence suggests a need for more attention to the collection end of the waste handling process and to the local socio-cultural factors that “make or break” waste management systems.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a cascading failure model with star interdependent links. To describe the model theoretically, a generalized percolation theory is developed. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, we study the phase transition of the system on artificial networks. On both ER-ER and SF-SF networks, the system exhibits a continuous (discontinuous) phase transition for small (large) fraction of service nodes. On ER-ER networks, the more service links of a service node, the system is more likely to exhibit a discontinuous phase transition. On SF-SF networks, the service links of a service node cannot alter the phase of the system. Our suggested theory agrees well with the numerical simulations.

T2  - Transportation Research Part B: Methodological
AB  - Schedule coordination is a proven strategy to improve the connectivity and service quality for bus networks, whereas current research mostly optimizes schedule design using the a priori knowledge of users’ routings and ignores the behavioural reactions to coordination status. This study proposes a novel stochastic bus schedule coordination design with demand assignment and passenger rerouting in case of transfer failure. To this end, we develop a bi-level programming model in which the schedule design (headways and slack times) and passenger route choice are determined simultaneously via two travel strategies: non-adaptive and adaptive routings. In the second strategy, transfer passengers would modify their paths in case of missed connection. In this way, the expected network flow distribution is dependent on both the transfer reliability and network structure. The upper-level problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program with the objective of minimizing the total system cost, including both operation cost and user cost, while the lower-level problem is route choice (pre-trip and on-trip) model for timed-transfer service. A more generalized inter-ratio headways scenario is also taken into account. A heuristic algorithm and the method of successive averages are comprehensively applied for solving the bi-level model. Results show that when the rerouting behaviour is considered, more cost-effective schedule coordination scheme with less slack times can be achieved, and ignoring such effect would underestimate the efficacy of schedule coordination scheme.

AB  - Corrosion attack in the form of corrosion product tubercles was observed in an AISI 304 (EN 1.4301) stainless steel heat exchanger only after 36 months of service. Failure analyses revealed that in one of the attacked areas corrosion had penetrated the entire wall thickness of 6.2mm, but in most of the cases it reached the depth of 2–4mm. In this paper, we report the results from a thorough microstructural characterization of the corroded heat exchanger carried out with optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Microstructural studies by OM, SEM and XRD revealed a two-phase structure of austenite and ferrite in the bulk material, as well as the preferential attack of the ferrite phase. SEM surface studies disclosed bacteria in and close to the attacked areas. Cross-sectional SEM examinations showed the distribution and composition of corrosion products within and underneath the tubercles. TEM and XRD studies gave information about the amorphous and/or nanocrystalline nature of some of the formed corrosion products. These results are discussed in this paper and, based on them, the main corrosion mechanism for the observed attack is suggested. Further, explanations for the propagation of corrosion along the ferrite phase are presented.

T2  - International Journal of Hospitality Management
AB  - The hotel business is highly sensitive to economic cycles, as the industry faces high frequency and high fluctuation of uncertainty over the demand for lodging services. Without a thorough consideration on the issue, hotels may undergo a business crisis. This research therefore investigates the influence of demand uncertainty on hotel failure by using the operation data of international tourist hotels in Taiwan during 1995–2008. The analysis applies two stages of estimation. The first stage employs a first-order autoregressive model, AR(1), to model lodging demand uncertainty. The second stage estimates the likelihood of hotels’ failure by using a logit model. The results are supportive to determine that the demand uncertainty causes hotel failures.

The aim of this research is to determine the optimal cycle length, optimal production quantity and optimal backordered quantity of each product such that the expected total cost (holding, shortage, production, setup, defective items and repair costs) is minimized. Two numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are provided to illustrate the practical usage of the proposed method.

AB  - An Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) is formed by a set of manufacturing and service businesses located together in a bounded geographic area and interconnected in Industrial Symbiosis (IS), aiming at enhancing environmental, economic and social performances of the EIP itself and its individual Industrial Actors (IA). Connections of IA to Critical Infrastructures (CI), such as for electricity and water supply, together with the newly created IS interconnections make EIP vulnerable to disruptive events propagation, whereby a failure in a CI outside EIP may propagate to EIP and its IA in a cascading effect. The interdependencies created by the interconnections of various CI and IS in the EIP should be closely investigated in order to predict the behaviour of the interconnected EIP, to evaluate the risk of disruptive events propagation and propose mitigation solutions. Different approaches exists for this, requiring different levels of details, model sophistication and complexity, data for parameters estimation. The present paper focuses on the expert-based Input-output Inoperability Model (IIM) and proposes a methodology for its complete deployment on the existing EIP of Kalundborg. The results obtained from the application to this EIP can be used to provide guidance for establishing measures of resilience to disruptive events, in terms of possible technological solutions and adjustment strategies to increase overall EIP resilience.

TI  - Payments for environmental services as neoliberal market-based forest conservation in Vietnam: Panacea or problem?
AU  - McElwee, Pamela D.
T2  - The Global Rise and Local Implications of Market-Oriented Conservation Governance
AB  - Recently in Vietnam, a coalition of international NGOs, donors and government officials have been promoting market-based forest conservation projects in the form of payments for environmental services (PES) as a win–win for both conservation and development objectives; Vietnam is now the first country in Southeast Asia with a national law on PES. This article provides a macro survey of how market-based instruments for forest conservation have expanded in Vietnam, particularly in relation to a long dominant state sector. Yet an assessment of Vietnam’s PES pilot projects indicates that they do not follow predicted orthodox “neoliberalization of nature” approaches in their use of market instruments, particularly in regards to privatization, retreat of the state, and capitalization of commodities. The article explores how it is that a strong state role in forest management can continue to dominate even in more market-oriented approaches. Finally, the article analyzes PES’s potential for success or failure in tackling the underlying causes for forest degradation. Ultimately, the article argues that PES is likely to be unable to tackle several of the key underlying causes for deforestation, namely, uneven land tenure and a lack of participation by local communities in conservation, given that PES is unlikely to be considerably different than past attempts at forest management.

T2  - Industrial Marketing Management
AB  - This paper examines the dark side of using reseller networks to provide after-sales services. A proposal made by previous research studies on the use of brand-reseller relationships for management of value to be delivered remotely through reseller networks was reviewed. Technical inability, with a focus on the sales of resellers of information technology (IT) and information technology-enabled services/products (ITES), was highlighted as one of the major challenges faced by brands. Unsuccessful delivery and failure of VARs to provide after-sales services puts brand performance at risk and, as a consequence, negatively influences perceptions of other resellers concerning the brand. Thus a VAR's inability to support customers can discourage resellers from offering the brand to their customers. This dark side of network interdependence negatively affects the shared brand-reseller goal of value co-creation. Applying data collected from 334 resellers of technology brands in India, this research focuses on the current periphery of international branding literature by focusing on the dark side of manufacturer brand-reseller relationships. From the relationship management perspective, we contribute to the recognition of value-at-risk as the dark side of the brand-reseller relationship. Based on empirical findings, we propose a business model that will enable manufacturer brands to control the brand value perceived by their resellers, by monitoring the actions of their VARs.

AU  - Blum, Helcio

T2  - Energy Economics
AB  - Energy is a key-resource to economic development and is required to be available continuously and in adequate amounts. Also, it is expected to be affordable and environmentally friendly. Ensuring this is a challenge, yet strategic to maintain economies running under a sustainable pattern. Energy security is neither a new concept, nor a new concern. However, because of new issues, it requires a novel, broader approach. Such an approach should address both demand (security of supply) and supply (security of demand) sides, as well as take into account energy scarcity situations and surplus opportunities. In addition, it should allow for both private (markets) and public (policies and regulations) initiatives. This paper presents a theoretical and practical basis for the economics of energy security. Energy security is defined, in this context, as the ability of an economy to provide sufficient, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy services so as to maintain a maximum welfare state, even when issues would press it otherwise. We introduce the notion of energy security gap to represent the economy's failure to show such ability. Additionally, we also propose a framework to support the evaluation, planning and implementation of energy security in an economy. This framework relies on the concepts of resilience, adaptability and transformability (Walker et al, 2004) to prescribe indicators to assess the energy security of an economy. Furthermore, it proposes mechanisms to enhance energy security, as well as a continuous process to increasingly achieve this.

T2  - Social Science & Medicine
AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a Latin America endemic and neglected tropical disease that affects primarily poor people living in rural areas. Its current low profile leads to many diagnostic, treatment, and control challenges. This study aimed to identify and characterize the sociocultural dynamics that influence CD health care in Colombia. Data for our ethnographic study was collected in 2013 and included participant observation in two main endemic areas in Colombia. In addition, 81 people belonging to four groups (patients and family members; health care workers; researchers; and officers) were recruited through snowball sampling technique and participated in informal and semi-structured interviews. People from the first two groups also participated in social cartography excercises. Data analysis resulted in the identification of three main sociocultural dynamics. Local Understandings: Patients reported confusions around disease transmission, treatment effectiveness and development of future complications. Providers' Knowledge and Training: Failures in professional's knowledge and training mostly affect the primary level of care in rural areas. Professionals undergo minimal training during medical school and lack access to continuous education. In contrast, clinicians working at tertiary university hospitals or at the CD unit of the Colombian National Institute of Health (NIH) exhibited great knowledge and competency. Health Care System Barriers: The Colombian market-based health care reform augmented access barriers, which impacted CD care greatly. We identified geographic and bureaucratic itineraries that depended on type of insurance plan, insurance contracts with service providing institutions, and levels of care. This study shows that people's experience of these sociocultural dynamics vary depending on their mobility from rural to urban contexts. It unveils the importance of analyzing the structure of the health care system. In the Colombian case, its for-profit orientation has become one of the most important obstacles for comprehensive, integrated, and timely health care responses.

AB  - Corrosion is the main reason for the failure of buried gas pipelines. For effective corrosion failure probability analysis, the structural reliability theory was adopted in this study to establish two calculation models for pipeline corrosion failure: the pressure failure model and von Mises stress failure model. Then, two calculation models for the corrosion failure probability were established based on a corrosion depth growth model obtained from actual survey data of soil corrosion characteristics. In an example, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and subset simulation (SS) were used to analyze the corrosion failure probability of pipelines, and the results were compared. SS can compensate for the shortcomings of MCS as it has higher computational efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, SS was adopted to simulate variations in the corrosion failure probability of buried pipelines with the service time for the two failure probability calculation models, which were applied to a natural gas pipeline located in a chemical industry park in Zhuhai, China. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the relevant parameters that affect the failure probability. The results showed that multiple loads caused by the covering soil, residual stress, temperature differential, and bending stress have a non-negligible effect on the pipeline reliability. The corrosion coefficients gradually become the most important factors that affect the failure probability with increased service time. The proposed methodology considers the actual operating conditions of pipelines to provide a reliable theoretical basis for integrity management.

AB  - Sealing problems cause premature retirement of Lithium-ion pouch cells and potential safety accidents in the service stage. This paper mainly investigates the sealing failure behavior of Li-ion pouch cell. A CZM-based peeling model is established to explain the actual sealing failure behavior of the soft package in the cohesive zone. Based on the peeling model, a degradation model is established to describe the decrease of the debonding strength and feature length in the cohesive zone. It can explain the decrease of the maximum peeling force as the sealing performance degradation indication of Li-ion pouch cell. Then, the reliability function using a stress-strength interference model is built for the sealing life prediction. Meanwhile, the gamma process is utilized to describe the variety of the strength and stress. Finally, experiments and discussion are presented to validate our method. The result shows that our method can provide a significant reference for the sealing life prediction of Li-ion pouch cell working under different variable loads.

T2  - European Journal of Operational Research
AB  - In this paper, we consider a multi-period, multi-product production planning problem where the production rate and the customer service level are random variables due to machine breakdowns. In order to determine robust production plans, constraints are introduced in the stochastic capacitated lot-sizing problem to ensure that a pre-specified customer service level is met with high probability. The probability of meeting a service level is evaluated by using the first passage time theory of a Wiener process to a boundary. A two-step optimization approach is proposed to solve the developed model. In the first step, the mean-value deterministic model is solved. Then, a method is proposed in the second step to improve the probability of meeting service level. The resulting approach has the advantage of not being a scenario-based one. It is shown that substantial improvements in service level robustness are often possible with minimal increases in expected cost.

AB  - Network reliability and resilience has become a key design parameter for network operators and Internet service providers. These often seek ways to have their networks fully operational for at least 99.999% of the time, regardless of the number and type of failures that may occur in their networks. This article presents a continuous-time Markov chain model to characterise the propagation of failures in optical GMPLS rings. Two types of failures are considered depending on whether they affect only the control plane, or both the control and data planes of the node. Additionally, it is assumed that control failures propagate along the ring infecting neighbouring nodes, as stated by the Susceptible-Infected-Disabled (SID) propagation model taken from epidemic-based propagation models. A few numerical examples are performed to demonstrate that the CTMC model provides a set of guidelines for selecting the appropriate repair rates in order to attain specific availability requirements, both in the control plane and the data plane.

T2  - Case Studies on Transport Policy
AB  - Consumers live in an omnichannel environment, in which they use both online and offline channels for their shopping activities. The result is an increase in parcels shipped to consumers’ homes, challenging urban freight systems in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Many measures exist, that aim to optimise and improve activities of logistics service providers in urban areas. However, research on the parcel market and its actors is limited, so it is unclear how parcel distribution is organised and which city logistics measures are (not) adopted. This information is needed to re-think parcel distribution and support policy-making that sustains and improves urban sustainability and quality of life. Therefore, we carried out case-study research with focus on Brussels, Belgium’s largest city and capital. Findings demonstrate that logistics service providers are focused on measures that improve distribution efficiency, which is determined by parcel volume, stop density, delivery failure and urban regulation. To this end, pick-up points and lockers and tools to affect receiver behaviour are implemented most. Generally, Brussels’ parcel distribution market is dominated by conventional vehicles and traditional modes of operation, but regulations and policies are advancing the use of micro-hubs in combination with cargo-bikes. Local authorities can facilitate adoption of city logistics measures for parcel distribution by cooperating and exchanging information with the private sector and by developing a harmonised, long-term vision on freight transport policy across cities and regions.

T2  - Composites Part B: Engineering
AB  - The construction industry has seen a proliferation of continuous and discontinuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites due to their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios while being resilience to harsh environmental and operating conditions. This paper reports a comparative experimental investigation of field-deployed E-glass/Epoxy composite panels with those freshly manufactured to elucidate the effect of deployment conditions on the performance of these panels. Samples extracted from underground vault after power-line explosion due to arcing fault were examined using optical and atomic force microscopes to assess the extent of the damage. The samples were also characterized using a dynamic mechanical analyzer to explain the change in the properties post-explosion quantitatively. Microscopy investigations show no significant change in morphology or topography of the panels as well as the absence of failure modes such as delamination, fiber-failure or core-failure. Nonetheless, surface contaminations due to service conditions were found to exaggerate the surface burn marks despite the fire retardation properties of the composite panels. The dynamic mechanical properties of the panels were found to change as a function of temperature and loading frequency slightly. A shift in transition temperatures (Tβ and Tg) was found to be within a few degrees Celsius. The storage modulus was reduced by 21%, while the overall complex modulus remained relatively constant when comparing fresh and field-deployed samples. A frequency and temperature dependent model was used to fit the dynamic data and found to provide insights into the microstructure evolution of the polymer matrix.

AB  - This paper investigates the failure mechanism of Fine-pitch Ball Grid Array (FBGA) solder joints of memory modules due to harmonic excitation by the experiments and the finite element method. A finite element model of the memory module was developed, and the natural frequencies and modes were calculated and verified by experimental modal testing. Modal damping ratios are also obtained and used in the forced vibration analysis. The experimental setup was developed to monitor resistance variation of FBGA solder joints due to the harmonic excitation under Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) standard service conditions. Experiments showed that the failure of the solder joints of the memory module under vibration mainly occurs due to resonance. Forced vibration analysis was performed to determine the solder joints having high stress concentration under harmonic excitation. It showed that failure occurs due to the relative displacement between PCB and package and solder joints are the most vulnerable part of the memory module under vibration. It also showed that cracked solder joints in the experiments match those in the simulations with the highest stress concentration.

T2  - Contraception
AB  - Objectives
This study describes women's reasons for seeking ulipristal acetate (UPA) for emergency contraception (EC) through the only authorized online retailer for UPA EC in the US.
Study design
Women aged 14 to 59 years, living in states that allow prescription medications to be shipped from out-of-state, accessed the KwikMed online pharmacy between January 2011 and December 2015. After completing a medical eligibility screener, women answered optional multiple-choice questions. To obtain UPA through KwikMed, individuals must be female, 50 years of age or younger, not currently pregnant or breastfeeding and not attempting to order UPA more than once within 30 days or more than four times per year.
Results
Over the 5-year period, KwikMed provided 8019 prescriptions for UPA, and the number of women using this service more than tripled over time. Among women who responded to the survey questions (n=7133; response rate = 89%), most sought EC because of a condom failure (45.3%) or because they did not use regular contraception (41.2%). More than half (53.5%) of women reported that they chose UPA because of its effectiveness compared to levonorgestrel EC pills, and 58.9% preferred ordering UPA online because they found it easier than getting it from a doctor, clinic or pharmacy.
Conclusions
This study documents the importance of providing confidential services for acquiring EC online. Benefits of online access include convenience, less embarrassment, avoiding situations in which a provider might refuse to provide EC because of their own ideological belief and more reliable availability for this time-sensitive contraceptive.
Implications
Though physical, logistical and societal barriers can restrict women's access to EC, this study demonstrates that providing access to UPA online empowers women to obtain EC when they need it.

AB  - As a consequence of policies in Australia and New Zealand to increase competition in the utilities sector, regulatory agencies have been created in each state to provide independent and authorative advice on matters such as electricity pricing, access to infrastructure, service quality and security of supply. In addition arrangements have been established to maintain safety standards in the industry. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the major issues that have arisen in the creation of regulatory agencies responsible for electrical safety standards in Australia and New Zealand, and how they have impacted on liberalised electricity markets.

AB  - Renewable energies are a key element of the modern sustainable development. They play a key role in contributing to the reduction of the impact of fossil sources and to the energy supply in remote areas where the electrical grid cannot be reached. Due to the intermittent nature of the primary renewable resource, the feasibility assessment, the performance evaluation and the lifecycle management of a renewable power plant are very complex activities. In order to achieve a more accurate system modelling, improve the productivity prediction and better plan the lifecycle management activities, the modelling of a renewable plant may consider not only the physical process of energy transformation, but also the stochastic variability of the primary resource and the degradation mechanisms that affect the aging of the plant components resulting, eventually, in the failure of the system. This paper presents a modelling approach which integrates both the deterministic and the stochastic nature of renewable power plants using a novel methodology inspired from reliability engineering: the Stochastic Hybrid Fault Tree Automaton. The main steps for the design of a renewable power plant are discussed and implemented to estimate the energy production of a real photovoltaic power plant by means of a Monte Carlo simulation process. The proposed approach, modelling the failure behavior of the system, helps also with the evaluation of other key performance indicators like the power plant and the service availability.

AB  - We consider the discrete time tandem queues with single unreliable server at each service station and a buffer of finite capacity between service stations. The blocking after service (BAS) mechanism and operation dependent failure (ODF) rule are adopted. The service time of each server is a constant unit time. A failure of each server occurs in a time slot with a fixed probability and the repair time distribution of each server is of discrete phase type. In this paper, we present an approximate analysis for the system based on the decomposition method and show that the approach can be applied to the variants of the system.

AB  - Rapidly growing economies often have high population growth, resulting in agricultural expansion in rural areas and increased water demand in urban areas. Conversion of forests and woodlands to agriculture may threaten safe and reliable water supply in cities. This study assesses the regulating functions and economic values of forests and woodlands in meeting the water needs of two major cities in Tanzania and proposes an integrated modelling approach with a scenario-based analysis to estimate costs of water supply avoided by forest conservation. We use the process-based hydrological Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the role of woody habitats in the regulation of hydrological flow and sediment control. We find that the forests and woodlands play a significant role in regulating sediment load in rivers and reducing peak flows, with implications for the water supply from the Ruvu River to Dar es Salaam and Morogoro. A cost-based value assessment under water treatment works conditions up to 2016 suggests that water supply failure due to deforestation would cost Dar es Salaam USD 4.6–17.6 million per year and Morogoro USD 308 thousand per year. Stronger enforcement of forest and woodland protection in Tanzania must balance water policy objectives and food security.

T2  - Integration
AB  - Counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs) has become an increasingly vital concern for the security of commercial and mission-critical systems. Moreover, they pose an immense economic, security, and safety threat. We propose a comprehensive detection and prevention framework consisting of a multi-functional on-chip aging sensor, and post-fabrication authentication methodology. This framework targets several classes of counterfeit ICs, such as recycled, remarked, out-of-spec, cloned, and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor consists of both antifuse memory and aging sensors. To reduce reference-circuit related area-overhead, the initial electronic properties of sensor circuits are stored in a global database, accessed by unique chip via challenge-response pairs. Second, this work consists of a two aging-sensor approach, based on IC wear-out effects, using a recently proposed electromigration (EM) aging sensor and a ring oscillator aging sensor. This method can be effective for chip usage estimation of both short and long time periods. Hence, it can serve as a more accurate timer for the chip to meter the long term usage, which can allow for timed services of some functionality of a chip, in addition to detection of the recycled/remark ICs. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. All fabricated ICs will be registered in a global database and activated with a unique chip ID, which is written into the antifuse memory. Simulation results show that the combined aging sensors have a high degree of accuracy when compared to traditional on-chip sensors.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - With the development of the electric vehicle (EV) technology, the electric vehicle routing problems (EVRPs) have become a current focus for research. Although customer demands in the logistics service industry are often uncertain during the route planning stage, these demands have seldom been discussed in the existing literature on the EVRPs. This study presents an electric vehicle battery swap station (BSS) location-routing problem with stochastic demands, with the aim to determine a minimum cost scheme including the optimal number and location of BSSs with an optimal route plan based on stochastic customer demands. Furthermore, the classical recourse policy and preventive restocking policy are extended by considering the influences of both battery and vehicle capacity simultaneously. Subsequently, the concept of Pareto optimality is applied to the EVRP to expedite the selection of BSS sequences. To solve such a hybrid problem, a hybrid variable neighborhood search (HVNS) algorithm is proposed, which integrates the binary particle swarm optimization and variable neighborhood search to solve the location and routing problems interactively. In experimental studies, the HVNS is compared to five heuristic algorithms to verify its performance.

AB  - Fault tolerance evaluation has gained increasing importance. In this paper, the semi-Markov process is introduced to describe the fault tolerance of topology in wireless sensor networks. Considering that the changes of topology states leaded by node failure and the changes of topology states leaded by responding to node failure, the topology fault-tolerant state transfer model is established firstly. Then a new fault tolerance evaluation index of topology is proposed based on the property of topology providing network services under different states. The numerical result shows that the topological fault tolerance calculated by the evaluation index and its actual value are consistent, which verifies that the proposed evaluation index can reflect the topological fault tolerance accurately. Moreover, the key factor influencing the topological fault tolerance is also obtained from calculating the sensitivity of parameters in the evaluation index.

AB  - Polyoxymethylene (POM), a thermoplastic polymer used in precision parts, is popular for its high stiffness, low friction, and resistance to various working fluids. The polymer also presents unique chemical degradation and aging mechanisms. An investigation into commercial POM-made fuel valves (commercial, heat-stabilized copolymer), which failed in similar ways after over a decade of service in an aviation system, is presented and compared to an unused valve of the same type and material, with failures induced by overload. A comparison between fracture surfaces imaged by SEM microscopy, of POM failure as a result of overload or as result of ten years aging is shown for the first time. No definitive differences were found between aged and new POM material based on Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and direct Fourier Transfer Infra-Red (FTIR) measurements. However, a significant difference in decomposition profiles was found according to Thermogravimetric Analysis coupled with FTIR (TGA-FTIR), accompanied by release of formaldehyde, indicative of depolymerization in the decade-aged POM. Other mechanisms, such as overpressure failure, effects of exposure to gasoline, increased crystallinity, intermolecular rearrangements or internal hydrolysis were refuted. The failure mechanism is attributed to aging depolymerization in the bulk, accompanied by static stress.

TI  - Models for Deployment of Solar PV Lighting Applications in Rural India
AU  - Anand, Saumya

T2  - 5th International Conference on Advances in Energy Research (ICAER) 2015
AB  - Promotion of solar energy is one of the majorsteps taken by the Government of India in its pursuit of sustainable development in recent years. In spite of the growth in electricity generation capacity reaching to 272.5GW, 75.02 million households, mainly in rural areas, are not yet electrified. Out of these, 72.4 million rural households use kerosene as primary lighting source whereas, only 0.92 million rural households use solar energy as primary lighting source (Census, 2011). Although solar PV lighting applications are better alternative in terms of quality of illumination, durability and versatility of use, there has been limited success with the deployment of this technology. This study has analysed various business models for deployment of solar PV lighting applications to identify the determinants of success and failure in rural India. The study is based on case studies, survey and interaction with various stakeholders. A variety of socio-economic, technical and market barriers have been identified. Those included are individual ownership models (Kattiwada in Madhya Pradesh, Hadi in Sindhudurg, Chavani in Raigad and Selco) and fee for service models (Amle in Palghar and Darewadi in Pune). The study shows that the major factors affecting the deployment of solar PV applications in rural areas are: the presence of local market for solar PV based products to create linkage between energy service providers and beneficiaries/end-user(s), availability of innovative financing mechanism to make product/ service affordable to the customers, awareness among people w.r.t. solar PV or other renewable energy technology, the reputation of vendor (or NGO) in the respective region which drives the acceptance of the product/ service, and willingness to pay for the product and its maintenance. Although an initial capital subsidy helps in acceptance of solar PV product/ service, the sustained use of product/ service is observed only when the users contributed fully or substantially towards the same. The lessons from the study can be extended to similar situations for other applications of solar PV technology (e.g. water pumping) or other renewable energy technologies.

While existing approaches aim to detect drifts in the process structure, Tesseract looks for temporal drifts in activity interim times. This orthogonal view on the process extends the traditional data cube of events – case id, activities and timestamps – by a fourth dimension and improves the operational support by a visualization of temporal drifts in real-time. Insights about temporal deviations lead to an augmented awareness of imminent failures or improved service times. The detection of related structural concept drifts can be improved by early warning, as operation times of critical parts often increase before they catastrophically fail.

In this paper we analyze the state of the art about the integration of product meta-data models, standardized engineering and business processes, Service Oriented Architecture and Decision Support System specifications in PLM. Moreover, we expand the field of application of the PLM on the service contexts, particularly looking at the logistic services. More precisely, we study the possibility of exploiting the PLM characteristics for the huge data management of the Decision Support System specification applied to the Intermodal Transportation Networks. Moreover, in order to evaluate the implementation success or failure of PLM in the Intermodal Transportation Networks context, a procedure for the successive PLM assessment and verification is outlined.

T2  - 15th Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing
AB  - Zimbabwe is endowed with a plethora of natural resources sufficient to provide raw materials and inputs to its engineering, mining and processing companies. Despite having inherited functional industries at independence, over the last 15 -20 years, the country has been grappling with recession, low capacity utilization, liquidation of companies and failure to export, let alone meeting local requirements. Although political instability has been largely attributed to this failure, ongoing research through surveys, interviews and direct observations at five companies involved in different business portfolios namely, furniture manufacturing, general engineering and foundry, assembly and manufacture of bus and truck bodies, backup and service of heavy vehicles as well as mineral processing, similarly revealed not only the lack of sustainability plans but also lack of involvement of all stakeholders in decision making in a systems thinking approach to ensure business continuity in different situations. The research also revealed that the failure to meet current needs without compromising the needs of the future could have contributed a great deal to low capacity utilization and eventual liquidations. Recommendations made to the companies were welcomed as clear opportunities to learn from the past and these are helping the companies to gradually recover and regain economic value in spite of the difficult operating environment.

From an institutional perspective, platform companies follow a reverse innovation process compared to innovation within traditional regulatory systems: they first launch their online platform and ask for government permission only later. We analyze the emergence of Uber as an institutional entrepreneur in The Netherlands and the strategies it employed in a failed attempt to get its UberPop service legalized through changes in Dutch taxi law. We conclude that Uber’s failure to change the Dutch taxi law stemmed from the difficulty to leverage pragmatic legitimacy among users into favorable regulatory changes in a highly institutionalized regime, because Uber’s institutional work strategies were not aligned.

AB  - Summary
Shared services arrangements have been viewed as a strategy for achieving efficiencies and improved service in back-office functions such as finance and accounting, human resource, and procurement. Organisations have been increasingly turning to vendors to implement and manage outsourced shared services arrangements. Analysing the experiences of a public sector organisation, this paper provides a detailed understanding of the issues involved in creating outsourced shared services arrangements. The findings have the highlighted the importance of strong governance to drive standardisation and performance improvement, and relationship building both internally with the staff affected by the changes and externally with vendors. Failure to implement a standardised approach will hinder an organisation from fully leveraging the specialist capabilities of external vendors.

AB  - Organisations need to develop attitudes and practices to manage risks, which surround any project. Project failure comes from inadequate implementation of risk management. Thus, risk management processes must be accurate, feasible and explain what should be included and not, clarify tasks and responsibilities and the way it should be accomplished. The purpose of this paper is to develop a standard process to compare different risk mitigation strategies and guide users in selecting the suitable actions based on consistent criterion. Based on validation and verification with a UK defence organisation, the paper offers an insight in to quantifying risk mitigation strategies.

TI  - Successful service retail channel expansions: The roles of technical and brand integration
AU  - Patel, Chirag
T2  - Special Issue on Integrating marketing and operations for business sustainability
AB  - Service retail channel (SRC) expansion is common in B2B markets, but expansions into high-tech channels involve substantial market failure risks. Successful expansions create questions about the best way to integrate new and existing channels. Should the firm use its existing brand to market the new channel, or should it develop a new brand? Should the technology for the new channel be developed in-house or outsourced? The level of integration of both marketing and technical assets determines the perceived consumer benefits and market acceptance of high-tech SRCs. Using the concepts of risk, resources, and control, this study proposes a theoretical framework, tested with data about Internet banking in the United States. The results show that integration decisions have important, counterintuitive consequences. Specifically technical integration leads to higher perceived consumer benefits and thus greater market acceptance, whereas brand integration lowers the market acceptance of a new SRC.

TI  - Capacity factor analysis for evaluating water and sanitation infrastructure choices for developing communities
AU  - Bouabid, Ali
AU  - Louis, Garrick E.
T2  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - 40% of the world's population lacks access to adequate supplies of water and sanitation services to sustain human health. In fact, more than 780 million people lack access to safe water supplies and about 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. Appropriate technology for water supply and sanitation (Watsan) systems is critical for sustained access to these services. Current approaches for the selection of Watsan technologies in developing communities have a high failure rate. It is estimated that 30%–60% of Watsan installed infrastructures in developing countries are not operating. Inappropriate technology is a common explanation for the high rate of failure of Watsan infrastructure, particularly in lower-income communities (Palaniappan et al., 2008). This paper presents the capacity factor analysis (CFA) model, for the assessment of a community's capacity to manage and sustain access to water supply and sanitation services. The CFA model is used for the assessment of a community's capacity to operate, and maintain a municipal sanitation service (MSS) such as, drinking water supply, wastewater and sewage treatment, and management of solid waste. The assessment of the community's capacity is based on seven capacity factors that have been identified as playing a key role in the sustainability of municipal sanitation services in developing communities (Louis, 2002). These capacity factors and their constituents are defined for each municipal sanitation service. Benchmarks and international standards for the constituents of the CFs are used to assess the capacity factors. The assessment of the community's capacity factors leads to determine the overall community capacity level (CCL) to manage a MSS. The CCL can then be used to assist the community in the selection of appropriate Watsan technologies for their MSS needs. The selection is done from Watsan technologies that require a capacity level to operate them that matches the assessed CCL of the community.

AB  - Based on mixed-methods, ethnographic research in government health facilities conducted in Rukwa, Tanzania over 23 months between 2012 and 2015, this paper explores the social implications of budget shortfalls in the healthcare system at the level of a regional hospital. Budget crises resulted from the late disbursal of funds and the failure of outside donors to meet aid commitments needed to subsidize healthcare at the national level. Healthcare administrators recounted specific donors who pulled out of commitments as a direct result of foreign government austerity measures enacted after the global financial crisis of 2008. In this environment of scarcity, partially due to years of reduced donor funds in the region, regional healthcare administrators circumvented bureaucratic fiscal procedures to ensure the continued functioning of facilities, and healthcare personnel struggled to provide pregnant women with high quality care in times of emergencies. Providers cited low morale and demotivation due to deteriorating physical infrastructure, lack of supplies, and poor relations with the community as key factors inhibiting their ability to care for the women who came to their facilities.

AU  - Zhang, Marina Yue
AU  - Gao, Jian
T2  - Contains Special Section: Emerging Technologies in Emerging Markets
AB  - An interactive innovation can be defined as an end-user application which is subject to network effects at both the demand and supply sides. As a result of network effects, the diffusion of such an innovation is predicted to follow a take-off curve coinciding with the advent of a critical mass of adopters. The current literature on innovation diffusion, mainly focusing on the demand-side dynamics, such as information cascades and herding behaviors among potential adopters, is not sufficient to explain the take-off (or the failure) of interactive innovations. In this paper, we present and examine a case study of the take-off of an interactive innovation, namely the caller-ring-back-tone (CRBT) and mobile music – mobile value-added services (MVAS) – in China. We find that supply-side dynamics, such as choices of platform strategies, helped drive the take-off of this innovation within China's institutional boundaries. The paper makes a contribution in two ways: first, it presents an ‘inside-out’ view of a unique case of take-off phenomenon; and, second it provides an integrated view combining factors from both the demand and supply sides to explain the take-off phenomenon, which is rare in empirical studies.

AB  - This paper deals with a discrete facility location model where service is provided at the facility sites. It is assumed that facilities can fail and customers do not have information on failures before reaching them. As a consequence, they may need to visit more than one facility, following an optimized search scheme, in order to get service. The goal of the problem is to locate p facilities in order to minimize the expected total travel cost. The paper presents two alternative mathematical programming formulations for this problem and proposes a matheuristic based on a network flow model to provide solutions to it. The computational burden of the presented formulations is tested and compared on a test-bed of instances.

Recognized by the Brazilian Government as a citizen's right, access to electricity was extended to almost 15million people since 2003 as a result of the “Luz Para Todos” (Light for all — LPT) program. However, considerable parts of the Amazon region still lack access to electricity services, largely due to the long distances that need to be covered and to challenging topography. This paper explores electrification using selected renewable sources, both for new installations and for hybridization of existing diesel generators. We present results from a multi-criteria analysis that explores trade-offs associated with electrification options. Techno-economic, environmental, social and institutional criteria and attributes are explored. We find that renewable and hybrid systems present a number of advantages for application in isolated areas of the region.

Simultaneous application of UV, thermal, humidity with DC electrical stress is applied to polymeric insulators enclosed in a specially fabricated climatic chamber. The stresses are applied for 1000 h for an adopted cycle to simulate close service life conditions. The leakage current is regularly monitored and recorded. After the experimentation, samples of the aged specimen are subjected for post analysis and psycho-chemical analysis like Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to monitor morphological changes, Energy Dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDAX) to observe elemental presence over the surface, Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy to examine chemical changes in the material, Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) to understand the role of filler in aged insulator specimen and loss of Loss of hydrophobicity was measured. Investigations with long duration DC stress reveal material degradation, depolymerization and loss of ATH; this could result in low thermal stability and accelerate the thermal erosion and early failures.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - Studies show that by the course of time, the number of natural disasters such as earthquakes is increasing. Therefore, developing a model for locating distribution centers and relief goods distribution systems in disaster times, along with appropriately locating health centers with the ease of access for transferring the casualties and saving their lives, is among the most essential concerns in relief logistics. Considering these two subjects, simultaneously, results in an increase in the quality of service in disaster zones. In this study, a multi-objective programming model is developed for locating relief goods distribution centers and health centers along with distributing relief goods and transferring the casualties to health centers, with pre/post-disaster budget constraints for goods and casualties logistics. For a better modelling of the reality, the uncertainties in demand, supply, and cost parameters are included in the model. Also, facility failure (e.g. relief distribution centers, health centers, hospitals and supply points failure) due to earthquakes is considered. The proposed model maximizes the response level to medical needs of the casualties, while targeting the justly distribution of relief goods and minimizing the total costs of preparedness and response phases. In order to handle the uncertainties, the robust optimization approach is utilized. The model is solved with ε – constraint method. For the large sized form, the MOGASA algorithm is proposed, and the results are compared to those of the NSGAII algorithm. Then the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is explored based on the results of both the proposed and exact methods.

AB  - Coke is one of the most important raw materials for iron making through blast furnace route. Strength and reactivity of coke plays a huge role in efficiency of the counter-current reactor. In order to attain the desired quality of coke, large lumps of coals are crushed in to smaller size fraction in a crushing mill using rotating hammers. However, the heads of these hammers fail prematurely during service that requires their frequent replacements along with interruption in production. This paper presents failure analysis of a coal crushing hammer head with its detailed metallurgical characterization. Analysis revealed that hammer heads fail in abrasive wear mode due to lean chemistry of the alloy used and lower hardness that manifests as higher abrasion rate. 6Cr1Mo steels were supplied in quenched and tempered conditions to a hardness of around 52 HRC. There was presence of only iron chromium carbides that is not sufficient to withstand an application involving extreme wear. The second part of this paper presents detailed chemistry-microstructure-wear resistance correlation for four different alloys; 6Cr1Mo, 20Cr1Mo, complex refractory alloy carbides and tungsten carbide weld deposited hard-facing. Microstructural analysis and phase identification is carried out using scanning electron microscope coupled with electron probe micro-analyzer, x-ray diffraction and Vickers hardness tester. Dry sand abrasion tests were carried out for the existing 6Cr-1 Mo steel and proposed trial specimens. Study shows that the abrasion resistance is strongly a function of type of carbides and their volume fraction. Niobium carbide and tungsten carbides are much more effective in improving the abrasion resistance of alloys compared to primary chromium carbides. Tungsten carbide hard-facing demonstrated the best abrasion resistance. Based on the study, a new design for hammer head with tungsten carbide hard-facing is developed and field trial revealed an improvement in service life greater than three times compared to existing 6Cr1Mo quenched and tempered hammer heads.

T2  - Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management
AB  - Information technology (IT) purchasing is covering an increasing part of companies’ expenditure. Scholars mainly investigated IT purchasing in terms of make or buy drivers from an IT perspective. Similarly, companies have been focusing on make or buy decisions and specifications definition in relation to technological characteristics. This often resulted in failures related to the goods/services purchased due to e.g. lack of negotiation skills, contracting, and suppliers’ relationship management. Accordingly, IT purchasing might require new structures and processes management. The purpose of the paper is to investigate what are the possible configurations for IT purchasing, and how these configurations are characterized in terms of purchasing process (i.e., strategic purchasing, sourcing and supply) and organization (i.e., roles involved, level of centralization, and span of control). Furthermore, the paper asks how IT relevance and purchasing maturity might affect these configurations. Through 12 case studies of leading international companies, four main configurations of the organization and the purchasing process for IT purchasing were identified, namely neutral (no specific approach is in place), IT oriented (the IT department takes the lead over the purchasing department), purchasing oriented (the purchasing department manages the whole IT sourcing process) and IT strategic (IT and purchasing departments jointly manage the IT purchasing process). The choice of the configuration is driven by IT strategic importance (low for neutral and purchasing oriented) and purchasing maturity of the company (low for neutral and IT oriented).

AB  - Bicycle sharing systems (BSS) arise as a proposal to respond to the challenges of urban mobility as a healthy, efficient, and relatively inexpensive mean of transportation. Although these systems are widespread, BSS still present challenges for implementation. In this context, this paper aims to identify the barriers to implementation of this kind of product-service systems (PSS) and to analyze which ones most impacted the failure of two BSS. The main results demonstrate that resistance to change both by users and those involved with the project hinders BSS implementation. Besides involving several actors, the system needs an adequate projection of the demand and costs. Some alternatives are: the integration of stakeholders in the development of the solution and the promotion of policies for the diffusion of sharing systems and education to conscious consumption. The results could be used in future PSS implementations to support overcoming the barriers.

AU  - Vela-Almeida, Diana

T2  - Ecological Economics
AB  - While the mining industry is steadfastly committed to the goal of increasing extraction of minerals, the failure to recognize the existence of biophysical constraints to extraction results in massive degradation to socio-ecological systems. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for analyzing mineral extraction which links the use and management of natural resources by means of the Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model developed by Georgescu-Roegen. Mining is a productive process that not only depletes minerals ores but also affects other natural resources that are needed to maintain life-supporting processes over time. The central claim is the need of recognizing the existence of biophysical limits to extraction in order to manage natural resources as irreplaceable providers of ecosystem services. By providing a new conceptualization for operationalizing the ecosystem services approach based on the Stock-Flow/Fund-Service model, we intend to challenge the current extractivist narrative that assumes unregulated practices, monetary indicators, technological advancements and substitutable resources. We argue that limits to mining activities should depend on a biophysical evaluation of the effects of these activities on the environment. Furthermore, social deliberation is required to determine whether extraction should occur and to what extent it is socially acceptable while still maintaining the integrity of socio-ecological systems.

AB  - A rapid thermal processor (RTP) device as well as quenching technique is employed to systematically investigate the effect of surface heat transfer coefficient (h) gradient on thermal shock failure of a hot-pressed ZrB2-based ceramic. Two typical kinds of quenchant with different surface h gradients during quenching tests, water and boiling water, are used for this study. When water as the cooling medium, two different cooling modes of indirect contact cooling by RTP device and direct contact cooling by quenching are also studied. The experimental results and related numerical simulations illustrate that surface h gradient plays an important role in thermal shock failure. This study confirms the previous presumption that the combination of body temperature gradient and surface h gradient leads to thermal stress damage and thermal shock failure. Under water quenching condition, water phase changes form bubbles randomly and produce great surface h gradient. Accordingly, critical body temperature gradient (V(max)c) is small (~ 270 °C s−1). Under aqueous polymer quenching condition, the introduction of polymer chains into water lowers the random formation of steam bubble and mediates the surface h gradient. The corresponding V(max)c hence become larger (~ 500 °C s−1). Under boiling water quenching condition, there is no surface h gradient and V(max)c is even larger (> 600 °C s−1). This study provides useful complementary information for understanding the thermal shock behavior and gives suggests for predicting materials performance in actual service.

AB  - The utilization of onsite generation system with renewable sources in manufacturing plants plays a critical role in improving the resilience, enhancing the sustainability, and bettering the cost effectiveness for manufacturers. When designing the capacity of onsite generation system, the manufacturing energy load needs to be met and the cost for building and operating such onsite system with renewable sources are two critical factors need to be carefully quantified. Due to the randomness of machine failures and the variation of local weather, it is challenging to determine the energy load and onsite generation supply at different time periods. In this paper, we first propose time series models to describe and predict the variation of the energy load of manufacturing system and the irradiation of solar energy. After that, a case study utilizing the predicted data is implemented. The case study includes different scenarios with respect to generation capacities, considering different predicted energy loads from manufacturing system. The cost for building and running such an onsite generation system and its corresponding service level are examined and discussed.

AB  - In this paper, Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs) are used to model and evaluate the performance and power consumption of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud. The proposed SAN model is scalable and flexible, yet encompasses some details of an IaaS cloud, such as Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning, VM multiplexing, and failure/repair behavior of VMs. Using the proposed SAN, a power-aware self-adaptive resource management scheme is presented for IaaS clouds that automatically adjusts the number of powered-on Physical Machines (PMs) regarding variable workloads in different time intervals. The proposed scheme respects user-oriented metrics by avoiding Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations while taking provider-oriented metrics into consideration. The behavior of the proposed scheme is analyzed when the arriving workload changes, and then its performance is compared with two non-adaptive baselines based on diverse performance and power consumption measures defined on the system. A validation of the proposed SAN model and the resource management scheme against an adapted version of the CloudSim framework is also presented.

AB  - Efficient and reliable maintainability management is a basic element behind ensuring sustainable practices for offshore assets. A method for easily implementing offshore asset maintainability management is proposed and described in terms of the maintainability decision-making process based on data-mining technology. A dataset of historical logs from operational systems drawn from offshore oil and gas service firms that have adopted sustainable maintenance management information system practices, including 12 main systems and 91 auxiliary systems, is used to inform a case study describing maintainability management and the decision-making process. The method uses the optimal values from a multicore classification model that adopts a goal-oriented data mining decision-making approach. Based on maintenance feature attributes, fault duration, fault loss, and frequency of occurrence in maintenance management are the three most important predictors of decision objectives. The decision tree classification results also indicate that the total average maintainability of assets in the key assets component is 53.4%, and the total average maintainability of noncritical assets is 37.9%. The five most important characteristic events found during maintenance and configuration processes were flaws in the tubing for A-annulus communication, leakage in the closed position, external leakage, failure to close on demand, and hydraulic failures that cause safety loss. The results provide unique insights into how offshore enterprise operators can improve maintainability management and decision-making performance using a data-driven decision strategy perspective. Furthermore, it provides a solution for visual proactive maintenance management and decision making under a data-driven framework, making it easier to implement maintenance management and decision-making tasks.

AB  - The representative adhesive structure of high-speed electric multiple units (EMU) is the side-window, the durability of which is concerned due to the degradation caused by changeable temperature and moisture in hostile service environment. It is of great significance to evaluate the adhesive structure's durability of side-window to prevent bonding failure. In this study, aluminium alloy single lap joints (SLJ), scarf joints (SJ) and butt joints (BJ) were manufactured to conduct accelerated aging tests under cyclic hydrothermal (CH)condition, in which the temperature and moisture vary from 80 °C/95% relative humidity (RH) to −40 °C/30%RH periodically. The adhesive Sikaflex®-265 were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The failure strength of adhesive joints was tested after different aging cycles and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also employed to investigate the microscopic fracture mechanisms. It has been found that the composition, glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature(Tm) and thermal stability of adhesive changes after CH aging. The failure strengths of SLJ, SJ and BJ show cubic polynomial descending with aging cycles, and loss about 30% of initial strength after 60 aging cycles. Moreover, the failure mode changes from cohesive failure to mixed failure after CH exposure, which is verified by SEM analysis. The failure criteria before and after CH aging were consistent with quadratic stress criteria, and an equation for a surface describing the variations of quadratic stress criterion with different aging cycles was built, providing reference for the durability evaluation of high-speed EMU's adhesive structures.

AB  - The usage of sensors and actuators in industrial applications has increased widely. Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has improved the usage of closed loop control systems using sensors and actuators. However the health of sensors & actuators and their impact on the efficiency of the industry is still a challenging area. The other important aspect is the network related issues that rise due to the large scale of sensors & actuators. There need an efficient mechanism that manages the network delay and packet drops associated with the large scale sensor deployments. There are machine learning techniques which are used to predict the sensor values when it is absent due to various reasons. Similarly, there are anomaly detection techniques that are used to detect faulty sensors. Both the prediction approaches fail to address the properties related to lifetime and service needs of sensors & actuators. This paper proposes a machine learning framework that combines the results of individual learning modules for achieving collective decisions. This proposed method provides the solution to address the delays and failures occurring in large scale deployments.

TI  - Managing the risk in housing delivery: Local government in South Africa
AU  - Tomlinson, Mary R.
T2  - Habitat International
AB  - South Africa’s Constitution and the White Papers on local government and housing direct the public sector to act in an equitable, transparent and accountable manner in the administration of its responsibilities. In contrast, a lack of capacity and coordination and pervasive corruption are the views commonly associated with local government, particularly when it comes to housing delivery. Critiques of local government’s failures, however, should seek to place them in the context of the functional mandate it has been prescribed as a means of determining whether or not their roles and responsibilities, with respect to housing delivery, are contributing to their poor service. More often then not, provincial government has taken on the role of housing deliverer, blurring the roles and responsibilities between the two spheres of government. The risk that arises from this situation is that, on the one hand, local governments are viewed by communities as being ‘responsible’ for delivery. On the other hand, they have no ‘authority’ to manage the risks that occur due to provinces stepping in and fulfilling this role. There is the potential, however, for managing these risks by devolving ‘responsibility’ and ‘authority’ for housing delivery to local government through ‘accreditation’ and assignment.

T2  - Papers presented at the 25th meeting of the Spanish Fracture Group
AB  - The objective of this work is to identify the causes that led to a failure of the crane hook in service. The study of the accident includes: (1) a summary and analysis of the peculiarities inherent to the standards that determine the manufacture and use of this type of device, (2) metallographic, chemical and fractographic analyses, (3) assessment of the steel mechanical behaviour in terms of Vickers hardness profile, its tensile strength and fracture energy, and (4) simulation of the thermal history of the hook. The visual and microstructural inspections reveal some evidences that a weld bed was deposited on the hook surface. Several cracks grew from that area into the material. Fracture surface shows features typical of brittle failures (transgranular cleavage fracture). The unalloyed, low-carbon steel contains a relatively low aluminium (<0.025%) and high non-combined nitrogen (>0.0075%) content. All the gathered evidences are in agreement with a strain-aging process triggering the embrittlement of the material, with the fracture starting from a crack generated at the heat affected zone of an uncontrolled welding of the hook.

TI  - Low-cost long-haul carriers: A hypothetical analysis of a ‘Kangaroo route’
AU  - Whyte, Randall

T2  - Case Studies on Transport Policy
AB  - Given the success of short-haul, low-cost airlines in most regional markets, it was expected that low-cost airlines would next venture into long-haul markets; however, most attempts in the past decade have, like their predecessors, failed. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a long-haul, low-cost operation based on a hypothetical airline that operates between Melbourne (Australia) and London (UK) can achieve a cost advantage compared to full-service airlines, but this advantage is not as great as the difference between low-cost carriers that operate in short-haul markets compared to full-service airlines (FSAs). Research to date on concept of low-cost long-haul airline operations is limited, but it does acknowledge that the cost differential between low-cost airlines and full-service airlines in short-haul regional markets is not as strong in long-haul operations. Factors such as larger and more expensive aircraft; flight-operating conditions including fuel burn; congestion around busy airports; crew costs; airport charges at main airports; and marketing issues such as branding, advertising and distribution all combine as deterrents for low-cost carriers to enter long-haul markets. This research confirms that it is possible for a low-cost, long-haul operation between Australia and the UK to attain a 13–17% cost advantage measured in cents per available seat kilometre (ASK) relative to full-service airlines.

AB  - Moisture damage is one of the major premature failures that worsens the performance and shortens service life of pavements. This research assesses the effect that two chemical modifiers (thiourea and an isocyanate-functionalized castor oil prepolymer) exerts on the bitumen rheology and on the resistance to potential moisture damage of asphalt mixtures based on siliceous aggregates. Both thiourea and the isocyanate-based prepolymer improve the viscous and viscoelastic behaviours of bitumen at high in-service temperatures, particularly the isocyanate-based reactive modifier. Likewise, the visual inspection of the degree of bitumen coating on loose mixtures exposed to water in a “rolling bottle” test, and further surface free energy measurements, showed that the bitumen modification by the isocyanate-based prepolymer seems to reduce moisture-induced damage on siliceous aggregates. Conversely, thiourea-based modification increases sensitivity of the bitumen–aggregate mixture to water. Different adhesion mechanisms, based on chemical or physical bonds with the aggregate surface, have been proposed for each modifier.

AB  - Critical infrastructures provide services that are essential for the support of everyday activities in modern societies. Being the result of a continuous process of integration of diverse technologies and organizations, they require a multi-disciplinary, systemic approach in order to be understood. In this respect, one of the most challenging issues is the analysis of infrastructures under disturbance or malfunctioning, and their ability to resist, react and recover, in a word the resilience. This paper presents a methodology of resilience analysis of systems of systems, with infrastructures as a special instance. A conceptual representation of the infrastructure, based on the functional relationships among its components, is given and then analyzed with respect to its structural and dynamic properties. Most critical and vulnerable components are identified. The response of the system to failure propagation is simulated in order to check if it is able to cope with them and recover in a resilient fashion. The analysis outcomes are used for a resilience-informed review of the infrastructure.

The gas distribution network is a critical infrastructure and its failure can cause damage to structures and injury to people. The aim of this paper is to analyze and then assess the risk of the Italian high pressure natural gas distribution network. The paper describes an application of a methodology for quantitative risk assessment. Failure frequencies considered in risk calculation were found in the European Gas pipeline Incident data Group (EGIG) database, whereas consequences were computed as a function of pipe diameter and operating pressure for each section of the network. The results of this quantitative risk assessment is the determination of local and social risks for the Italian North East Area.

T2  - Engineering Failure Analysis
AB  - An analysis of the fatigue crack growth and the corresponding residual life evaluation of the walking beam of an oilfield pumping unit are presented. Lifting lugs had been welded on the upper flange of the walking beam at the moment of assembling the machine. A crack nucleated at one of the weld toes and grew by fatigue up to the critical condition that led up to the instability of the waking beam after 10years of operation, taking the equipment out of service and producing important economic losses to the operating company. As the company operates many units working in similar conditions, the estimation of fatigue residual life presents interest in order to define inspection intervals for examinations by non-destructive testing. In this way, any crack growing by fatigue will be detected and repaired, preventing the catastrophic failure of the component. The stress cycle at the failure zone was calculated and the mechanical properties of the walking beam steel were determined. With this information the final failure conditions were analyzed by using the failure assessment diagram. The fatigue residual life was then estimated by means of a model developed to consider the particular features of the crack path related to the beam geometry. Different operating situations were considered. Finally, based on the results obtained, an interval of 12months between consecutive inspections of the examinations by non-destructive testing was proposed.

T2  - Reliability Engineering & System Safety
AB  - Transportation system resilience has been the subject of several recent studies. To assess the resilience of a transportation network, however, it is essential to model its interactions with and reliance on other lifelines. Prior works might consider these interactions implicitly, perhaps in the form of hazard impact scenarios wherein services from a second lifeline (e.g. power) are precluded due to a hazard event. In this paper, a bi-level, mixed-integer, stochastic program is presented for quantifying the resilience of a coupled traffic-power network under a host of potential natural or anthropogenic hazard-impact scenarios. A two-layer network representation is employed that includes details of both systems. Interdependencies between the urban traffic and electric power distribution systems are captured through linking variables and logical constraints. The modeling approach was applied on a case study developed on a portion of the signalized traffic-power distribution system in southern Minneapolis. The results of the case study show the importance of explicitly considering interdependencies between critical infrastructures in transportation resilience estimation. The results also provide insights on lifeline performance from an alternate power perspective.

T2  - Global Environmental Change
AB  - While national climate policy can address countries’ production or consumption, climate mitigation via changes in consumption has previously received relatively little attention in climate policy literature. In the absence of an effective international climate policy, the focus on consumption is gaining relevance since it has advantages regarding carbon leakage and competitiveness concerns. In addition, consumption oriented climate policy allows for low cost climate mitigation because of behavioral market failures. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of low greenhouse gas consumption options is needed. This article reviews the carbon footprint of products in the five main consumption categories (food, shelter, travel, goods and service) and compares their compatibility with the greenhouse gas intensity required in 2050 to meet the 2° climate target. The evaluation then identifies consumption options compatible with this climate target in all categories. The description of these consumption options allows for the recognition of barriers to their selection. In contrast to production oriented climate policy, besides costs, relevant barriers include consumer preferences, the skills required to find or adopt the product and high initial investments. We conclude that there is substantial climate mitigation potential from changing consumption choices which can be tapped through climate policy by addressing non-cost barriers.

Our approaches generalize the capacitated ring tree problem (CRTP) which asks for a partially reliable topology that connects customers with different security requirements to a depot node by combined ring and tree graphs. While the CRTP aims at optimizing the edge installation costs, we propose four alternative, reliability-oriented objective functions. We study the case of service interruptions due to single-edge failures, and consider the overall number of tree customers and tree edges, the maximal number of subtree customers, and the maximal number of tree hops from rings as additional measures. To model the corresponding novel bi-objective problems, we develop mathematical multi-commodity flow formulations and identify relationships between the new objectives. For identifying the Pareto fronts, we apply an ϵ-constraint method based on integer programming. The computational efficiency is increased by employing local search heuristics in order to tighten upper bounds and by valid inequalities to strengthen lower bounds in the subproblems. In a computational study we report results, illustrate solution network topologies and extensively analyze the algorithm performance for instances from the literature.

T2  - Journal of the Franklin Institute
AB  - The ongoing changes, updates, and upgrades of the Smart Grid infrastructure open up new cybersecurity challenges whose successful and satisfactory handling is a vital necessity for a viable future of these initiatives. The characteristic of the Smart Grid that leads to physical damage and cascading power failures amplifies the severity of security breaches. A set of recent successful Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, facilitated by the proliferation of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) powered botnets, shows that the Smart Grid may become the target and likely victim of such an attack, potentially leaving catastrophic outage of power service to millions of people. In this paper, under a hierarchical data collection infrastructure we propose a general and scalable mitigation approach, called Minimally Invasive Attack Mitigation via Detection Isolation and Localization (MIAMI-DIL), based on an online and nonparametric anomaly detection algorithm which is scalable and capable of timely detection. We provide a proof-of-concept by means of simulations to show the efficacy and scalability of the proposed approach.

TI  - Lessons from the response to the threat of transfusion-transmitted vCJD in Ireland
AU  - Murphy, W.G.
T2  - Séminaire d'actualité sur les prions et le risque transfusionnel - Mars 2011
AB  - By the time vCJD was first described in 1996, it was already far too late to offset further disaster from transmission of the disease by blood transfusion: almost all the humans who would be infected and infectious were already diseased. Nothing done by the blood transfusion services around that time, with the exception of excluding transfusion recipients as blood donors, would have made any useful contribution to containing the extent of the epidemic. The ability to spread emerging diseases before the problem is manifest or understood is a fixed and unavoidable feature of blood transfusion as it is practiced today. A second fixed property of blood transfusion is that the root cause of disaster is not within the control of the blood transfusion universe. Strategies that have emerged to cope with similar threat in other enterprises that also contain these properties comprise the components of robust design: surveillance, preparedness for action, engagement, herding together, evasion or avoidance, early adoption of potentially useful measures, engineered resilience, defence in depth, damage limitation including modularity and removal of feedback loops, and contingency, redundancy and failure management, and ultimately, individual escape. Early adoption of leucodepletion based on the possibility that it might work rather than any hard evidence was a good example of threat management. Exclusion of previously transfused donors is a robust mechanism for containing any future infection; optimal blood use structures that provide a national transfusion rate as low as possible also constitute an effective threat management strategy.
Résumé
Lorsque la maladie fut décrite pour la première fois en 1996, il était déjà trop tard pour mettre en place des actions préventives contre ce nouveau désastre potentiel de transmission transfusionnelle de la maladie : en effet, tous les sujets contaminés et probablement infectieux étaient déjà décédés. Aucune des mesures déjà mises en place à cette époque, à l’exception de l’exclusion des donneurs ayant été transfusés, auraient permis de lutter efficacement contre l’épidémie. La capacité qu’ont les maladies émergentes de se propager avant même que le problème soit identifié et compris est un caractéristique classique et courante en transfusion sanguine dans sa pratique actuelle. Une seconde caractéristique est que la racine du mal n’est pas sous contrôle en la transfusion sanguine. Les stratégies préventives vis-à-vis de risques émergents similaires rencontrés dans d’autres entreprises forment un plan d’actions robustes comprenant : la veille, la préparation à l’action, l’engagement, l’esprit d’équipe, l’évitement, la mise en place de mesures préventives précoces, la gestion de l’urgence, etc. La mise en place anticipée de la déleucocytation fondée sur le pari que cela pourrait avoir une action bénéfique est un bon exemple de gestion de risque. L’utilisation des produits sanguins à bon escient constitue également une stratégie de management efficace pour diminuer le risque potentiel de transmission par transfusion.

AB  - Everyday living is supported by an array of services provided by a complex local infrastructure nexus that is financed and funded by the public, private and third sectors. The on-going debate on the financialization of infrastructure has neglected to explore the provision of local infrastructure in places experiencing infrastructural exclusion. This paper seeks to contribute toward filling this gap by exploring local infrastructure in the UK that has been provided by blending non-capitalist with capitalist activities. In other words, the provision of local infrastructure using an ‘alternative’ approach that attempts to address infrastructure exclusion by filling gaps in the provision of local infrastructure. The question is: how is infrastructure provided when it does not meet either a value for money calculation undertaken by the state or does not meet the investment criteria required by capital markets? This paper is the first to develop a dialogue between three unrelated literatures - financialization, business models and alterity – by developing a conceptual framework for exploring local infrastructure that is provided by alternative-substitute business models. The paper explores this approach through the analysis of two alternative infrastructure projects – Broadband 4 the Rural North and Malvern’s heritage gas lamps.

T2  - Transportation Research Part B: Methodological
AB  - Many real-world service facilities are subject to probabilistic disruptions. Such disruptions often exhibit correlations that arise from shared external hazards or direct interactions among these facilities. This paper builds an overarching methodological framework for reliable facility location design under correlated facility disruptions. We first incorporate and extend the concepts of supporting station structure and quasi-probability from Li et al. (2013) and Xie et al. (2015), such that any correlated facility disruptions (positive and/or negative) can be equivalently represented by independent failures of a layer of properly constructed supporting stations, which are virtually added to the original facility system for capturing the effect of correlations among facilities. We then develop a compact mixed-integer mathematical model to optimize the facility location and customer assignment decisions in order to strike a balance between system reliability and cost efficiency. Lagrangian relaxation based algorithms, including modules for obtaining upper bound and lower bounds of relaxed subproblems, are proposed to effectively solve the optimization model. Numerical case studies are carried out to demonstrate the methodology, to test the performance of the framework, and to draw managerial insights.

AB  - This research activity aims at investigating the hydrogen embrittlement of Maraging steels in connection to real sudden failures of some of the suspension blades of the Virgo Project experimental apparatus. Some of them failed after 15 years of service in working conditions. Typically, in the Virgo detector, blades are loaded up to 50-60% of the material yield strength. For a deeper understanding of the failure, the relationship between hydrogen concentration and mechanical properties of the material, have been investigated with specimens prepared in order to simulate blade working conditions. A mechanical characterization of the material has been carried out by standard tensile testing in order to establish the effect of hydrogen content on the material strength. Further experimental activity was executed in order to characterize the fracture surface and to measure the hydrogen content. Finally, some of the failed blades have been analyzed in DICI-UNIPI laboratory. The experimental results show that the blades failure can be related with the hydrogen embrittlement phenomenon.

AB  - The offshore wind (OW) industry has reached reasonable maturity over the past decade and the European market currently consists of a diverse pool of investors. Often equity investors buy and sell stakes at different phases of the asset service life with a view to maximize their return on investment. A detailed assessment of the investment returns taking into account the technical parameters of the problem, is pertinent towards understanding the value of new and operational wind farms. This paper develops a high fidelity lifecycle techno-economic model, bringing together the most up-to-date data and parametric equations from databases and literature. Subsequently, based on a realistic case study of an OW farm in the UK, a sensitivity analysis is performed to test how input parameters influence the model output. Sensitivity analysis results highlight that the NPV is considerably sensitive to FinEX and revenue parameters, as well as to some OPEX parameters, i.e. the mean time to failure of the wind turbine components and the workboat significant wave height limit. Application of the model from the perspective of investors with different entry and exit timings derives the temporal return profiles, revealing important insights regarding the potential minimum asking and maximum offered price.

T2  - Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing
AB  - Prognostics is an emerging requirement of modern health monitoring that aims to increase the fidelity of failure-time predictions by the appropriate use of sensory and reliability information. In the aerospace industry it is a key technology to reduce life-cycle costs, improve reliability and asset availability for a diverse fleet of gas turbine engines. In this work, a Bayesian hierarchical model is selected to utilise fleet data from multiple assets to perform probabilistic estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) for civil aerospace gas turbine engines. The hierarchical formulation allows Bayesian updates of an individual predictive model to be made, based upon data received asynchronously from a fleet of assets with different in-service lives and for the entry of new assets into the fleet. In this paper, variational inference is applied to the hierarchical formulation to overcome the computational and convergence concerns that are raised by the numerical sampling techniques needed for inference in the original formulation. The algorithm is tested on synthetic data, where the quality of approximation is shown to be satisfactory with respect to prediction performance, computational speed, and ease of use. A case study of in-service gas turbine engine data demonstrates the value of integrating fleet data for accurately predicting degradation trajectories of assets.

AB  - Prediction of fatigue life is of great significance in ensuring that dynamically loaded rubber components exhibit safety and reliability in service. In this text, the dynamic equi-biaxial fatigue behaviour of magnetorheological elastomer (MREs) using a bubble inflation method is described. Wöhler (S–N) curves for both isotropic and anisotropic MREs were produced by subjecting the compounds to cycling over a range of stress amplitudes (σa) between 0.75 MPa and 1.4 MPa. Changes in physical properties, including variation in stress–strain relations and complex modulus (E*) during the fatigue process were analysed. It was found that the complex modulus of MRE samples decreased throughout the entire fatigue test and failure took place at a limiting value of approximately 1.228MPa ± 4.38% for isotropic MREs and 1.295 ± 10.33% for anisotropic MREs. It was also determined that a dynamic stored energy criterion can be used as a plausible predictor in determining the fatigue life of MREs.

AB  - The occurrence of ice accretion on cold surfaces such as airplanes, power lines and wind turbines can cause various degrees of damage such as flight failure and power outage. Therefore, the reduction of ice adhesion is of great significance and widen application in aviation field. Based on the research status of anti-icing liquid-infused porous surfaces (LIPS) materials, this work attempts to use high specific surface area microporous silica as the carrier to adsorb a large content of functional substances with properties of lubricity and moisture retention, such as silicone oil and polyethylene glycol, and elastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) crosslink polymer was selected as the substrate system. The functional substances are uniformly mixed in different proportions to construct different functional surfaces, which can form an oil/water lubricating layer interface between the cold air and the solid surface to reduce the ice adhesion strength. The functional coating in this work has a certain delaying frosting ability compared with uncoated aluminum plate and pure silicone rubber material in the low temperature environment of −10 °C to −15 °C. By testing the shear force between the ice and the cold surface, the ice adhesion strength on the functional substance dispersed material compared to the pure silicone rubber material can be reduced by 1/3 to 1/5, and can be reduced by 1/5 to 1/8 compared to the aluminum plate. It has a good low ice adhesion strength effect and can be used as anti-icing materials potentially.

AU  - Stolfi, A.

AU  - Sabatini, M.
T2  - Acta Astronautica
AB  - In the near future robotic systems will be playing an increasingly important role in space applications such as repairing, refueling, re-orbiting spacecraft and cleaning up the increasing amount of space debris. Space Manipulator Systems (SMSs) are robotic systems made of a bus (which has its own actuators such as thrusters and reaction wheels) equipped with one or more deployable arms. The present paper focuses on the issue of maintaining a stable first contact between the arms terminal parts (i.e. the end-effectors) and a non-cooperative target satellite, before the actual grasp is performed. The selected approach is a modified version of the Impedance Control algorithm in which the end-effector is controlled in order to make it behave like a mass-spring-damper system regardless of the reaction motion of the base, so to absorb the impact energy. The effects of non-modeled dynamics in control determination such as the structural flexibility of the manipulator and the target satellite are considered as well, and their impact on control effectiveness is analyzed. The performance of the proposed control architecture and a parametric analysis are studied by means of a co-simulation involving the MSC Adams multibody code (for describing the dynamics of the space robot and target) together with Simulink (for the determination of the control actions). The results show that the first contact phase of the grasping operation of a large satellite requires careful tuning of the control gains and a proper selection of the end-effector dimensions; otherwise, the large geometric and inertia characteristics of the target could lead to a failure with serious consequences. Both successful and underperforming cases are presented and commented in the paper.

AB  - The paper presents selected results of the adaptation of Lean Manufacturing methods to the mining industry conditions. The research was carried out within the framework of R&D project “Adaptation and implementation of Lean in the copper mines.” The article focuses on the key issues related to the Total Productive Maintenance. TPM in a mine according to Authors’ approach should be based on 3 main pillars: improvement of the environment of work, autonomous and planned maintenance and standards in development. In order to adapt TPM method to mining conditions several steps were taken. In the first step failure analysis was conducted. On the basis of its results, a pilot group of machines was selected. To ensure the best environment for implementing the method a holistic approach was applied. Three types of activities were performed in parallel – designing a room for pilot area machines, daily service process optimization and repair standardization. The coherent TPM methodology developed within the framework of Lean Mining project is so universal that it can be successfully implemented in the other mining companies, specializing in the underground and open pit mines and quarries, in order to increase their profitability and introduce continuous improvement approach.

T2  - Conserving complexity: Global change and community-scale interactions
AB  - Invasive species represent one of the most important threats to biodiversity worldwide, with consequences for ecosystem functioning and the delivery of important ecological services to society. Several hypotheses have been generated to explain the success of exotic plants in their new ranges, with escape from their old natural enemies, such as pathogens and herbivores (the ‘enemy release hypothesis’) and novel defensive chemistry (the ‘novel weapons hypothesis’) receiving considerable attention. Thus far, virtually all studies of exotic plants and insects have been conducted in a strictly bi-trophic framework involving plants and herbivores. On the other hand, it has been argued that a better understanding of the forces regulating community structure and function should include natural enemies of the herbivores. Furthermore, indirect interactions between organisms in the plant roots (below-ground) and shoots (above-ground) are known to strongly effect the behaviour and performance of consumers in the opposite ‘compartment’. Here, we discuss a range of physiological, evolutionary and ecological aspects of plant–herbivore-natural enemy interactions involving exotic plants. Further, interactions between soil and above-ground organisms are explored with respect to studies with exotic plants. We argue that it is important to link population and community ecology to individual-level variation in the physiology and behaviour of insects across several trophic levels in studies with invasive plants. Future research with invaders should also aim to integrate physically separated compartments (e.g. plant roots and shoots). This will facilitate a more complete understanding of the factors underlying the success (or failure) of exotic plants to spread and become dominant in their new ranges. Moreover, these data will also help to unravel the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes in regulating communities in which exotic plants have become established. Lastly, we discuss consequences for conservation.

AB  - Increasing the biodiversity of cropped plants is a key leverage for agroecology, aiming to replace chemical inputs by ecological processes and regulations. Cultivar mixtures are a straightforward way to increase within-crop diversity, but they have so far been poorly used by farmers and they are not encouraged by advisory services. Based on the methodology developed by Kiær et al. (2009), we achieved a meta-analysis of cultivar mixtures in wheat. Among the 120 publications dedicated to wheat, we selected 32 studies to analyze various factors that may condition the success or failure of wheat mixtures by calculating overyielding, i.e. the difference in productivity of a variety mixture compared with the weighted mean of its component varieties in pure stand. The analysis highlighted a significant global overyielding of 3.5%, which reached 6.2% in condition of high disease pressures. Overyielding was not affected by seeding density or plot size. Under high disease pressure, overyielding increased by 3.2% point per added component variety. Overyielding was respectively 5.3% and 3.3% higher for mixtures heterogeneous in disease resistance or phenology than for homogeneous ones, and did not vary when considering height. Overyielding reached its highest values in the 1980s and 1990s, which reflects the predominance of disease-focused studies during this period. Our results confirm that cultivar mixtures are a potential way to increase yield relatively to pure varieties, especially under low pesticide cropping systems. Literature suggests that mixture practice is impeded by the lack of general rules that could help to mixing varieties. To design such rules it is needed to (1) achieve new experiments manipulating the heterogeneity in variety traits, (2) determine experimentally the ecological mechanisms underlying mixture performance and (3) develop new models allowing testing and analyzing these mechanisms.

TI  - A bridge network maintenance framework for Pareto optimization of stakeholders/users costs
AU  - Orcesi, André D.

T2  - Reliability Engineering & System Safety
AB  - For managing highway bridges, stakeholders require efficient and practical decision making techniques. In a context of limited bridge management budget, it is crucial to determine the most effective breakdown of financial resources over the different structures of a bridge network. Bridge management systems (BMSs) have been developed for such a purpose. However, they generally rely on an individual approach. The influence of the position of bridges in the transportation network, the consequences of inadequate service for the network users, due to maintenance actions or bridge failure, are not taken into consideration. Therefore, maintenance strategies obtained with current BMSs do not necessarily lead to an optimal level of service (LOS) of the bridge network for the users of the transportation network. Besides, the assessment of the structural performance of highway bridges usually requires the access to the geometrical and mechanical properties of its components. Such information might not be available for all structures in a bridge network for which managers try to schedule and prioritize maintenance strategies. On the contrary, visual inspections are performed regularly and information is generally available for all structures of the bridge network. The objective of this paper is threefold (i) propose an advanced network-level bridge management system considering the position of each bridge in the transportation network, (ii) use information obtained at visual inspections to assess the performance of bridges, and (iii) compare optimal maintenance strategies, obtained with a genetic algorithm, when considering interests of users and bridge owner either separately as conflicting criteria, or simultaneously as a common interest for the whole community. In each case, safety and serviceability aspects are taken into account in the model when determining optimal strategies. The theoretical and numerical developments are applied on a French bridge network.

T2  - Construction and Building Materials
AB  - An experimental study was performed to determine the environmental durability of adhesive bond between Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer pultruded profile and concrete. The specimens were subjected to two artificial ageing regimes before being tested to failure. Some specimens were exposed to 50 freeze-thaw cycles and other were immersed in water at 45 °C for varying time periods. Furthermore, some specimens were exposed to natural outdoor conditions to up to one year. The water effect on the adhesion of the joints was found to be significant, especially at longer immersion times; the shear strength of push out specimens reduced by 71% after ten months of immersion and the failure mode was shifted from cohesive within concrete to adhesive at the adhesive/concrete interface. The results also show that the ultimate shear strength deteriorated measurably during freeze-thaw cycling, about 56% of reduction was obtained after just 50 cycles, while after one year of outdoor exposure, the shear strength dropped by 27.7% compared to those without ageing. The study suggests that the ageing tests can provide information about the effects of environmental agents in the durability of bonded structures but cannot estimate the real amount of deterioration in real service life of such structures.

T2  - Journal of Network and Computer Applications
AB  - Sensor network deployed for the critical infrastructure monitoring requires high degree of reliability in sensory data gathering, in spite of arbitrary node or sink failures. This paper proposes a robust data gathering scheme specially designed to provide guaranteed delivery of the sensory data for applications on the critical infrastructure monitoring. Redundancy in a sensor network, in terms of both the number of deployed sensors and the amount of duplicate data delivery, is explored to design an effective protocol that ensures the reliable data delivery while assuring the timeliness, connectivity and the sensing coverage. A set of active sensors is selected from all the sensors deployed, based on the network connectivity and the sensing coverage criteria that participates in the data forwarding process. Rest of the sensors go to the sleep state, and act as a replacement on the failure of an active sensor. The proposed protocol aims to find out multiple node-disjoint paths to multiple sinks, so that the loss of connectivity in one path due to node failure does not disrupt application services. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been analyzed using simulation results, and compared with other protocols proposed in the literature for reliable data delivery.

AB  - A model is presented for analyzing Pareto-efficient build-operate-transfer toll road contracts. The formulation simultaneously allows maximizing social welfare and private profit when road users vary in their value-of-time (VOT). The failure rate and mean residual functions of the VOT distribution are used to characterize Pareto-efficient solutions. Service quality, measured in terms of the volume-to-capacity ratio, is shown to be better than, identical to, or lower than the socially optimal level depending on the curvature of the mean residual VOT function. The outcomes of various regulatory regimes are examined as well.

AB  - Thermoplastic polymers such as HDPE are nowadays widely used as lining materials for oil and gas pipelines. However, during maintenance or unexpected service stoppages, these liners can undergo external pressure induced bucking collapse. The objective of this work is to assess the mechanical response of HDPE liners undergoing buckling collapse by means of Finite element modeling (FEM) simulations on Abaqus 6.10. To accomplish this, an advanced constitutive model, namely the Three Network Model (TNM) was employed. In order to determine the input parameters for the model, a series of tensile and compressive uniaxial tests were conducted. The suitability of the model for this particular application was assessed by contrasting the simulation and the experimental results of a diametral compression test. The complex strain rate and pressure dependent mechanical response of HDPE liners was analyzed by modeling the buckling collapse dynamic event as an increasing volume of fluid entering the gap cavity between liner and host pipe. The model predictions allowed establishing a mathematical relationship between the depressurization velocity of the tubes and the resulting collapse pressure. These relations can be used to improve the current design guidelines for plastic liners.

TI  - “Orpaillage pays for everything”: How artisanal mining supported rural institutions following Mali's coup d’état
AU  - Teschner, Benjamin A.
T2  - ‘The Futures of Small-Scale Mining in Sub-Saharan Africa’
AB  - This paper argues that during the period after the March 2012 coup d’etat in Mali, rural institutions in gold-rich areas of country shifted their revenue dependence away from the state and instead drew upon a local, evolving artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector. The paper discusses the effects of the March 2012 coup and its aftermath on the state and how these changes trickled down to local institutions in the rural commune of Yallankoro-Soloba. During that same period, technological advances in the commune's ASM sector increased local investment and improved profitability in ASM activities. As the state withdrew financial support from the commune government and social services, local government officials, medical services, educational institutions and local populations were able to capitalize on these ASM-generated revenues. The research finds that Mali suffers from the same ASM formalization problems as other mineral rich countries in the region. What makes Mali's situation unique is that ASM has become a critical rural industry which is not only supplying much needed income to rural people, but also serving to informally fund social institutions from the bottom up during a time of national crisis. Local government officials are stuck in limbo between the state which provides them with legitimacy and ASM which supports their communes’ population and institutions. The paper concludes that even as Mali begins its recovery, there are urgent needs to formalize rural ASM. If formalization actions are delayed, technological advances will make formalization even more difficult and enable institutions and local officials to become increasingly detached from the fragile central government.

TI  - Bayesian Hierarchical Models for aerospace gas turbine engine prognostics
AU  - Zaidan, Martha A.

T2  - Expert Systems with Applications
AB  - Improved prognostics is an emerging requirement for modern health monitoring that aims to increase the fidelity of failure-time predictions by the appropriate use of sensory and reliability information. In the aerospace industry, it is a key technology to maximise aircraft availability, offering a route to increase time in-service and to reduce operational disruption through improved asset management. An aircraft engine is a complex system comprising multiple subsystems that have dependent interactions so it is difficult to construct a model of its degradation dynamics based on physical principles. This complexity suggests that a statistically robust methodology for handling large quantities of real-time data would be more appropriate. In this work, therefore, a Bayesian approach is taken to exploit fleet-wide data from multiple assets to perform probabilistic estimation of remaining useful life for civil aerospace gas turbine engines. The paper establishes a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to perform inference and inform a probabilistic model of remaining useful life. Its performance is compared with that of an existing Bayesian non-Hierarchical Model and is found to be superior in typical (heterogeneous) scenarios. The techniques use Bayesian methods to combine two sources of information: historical in-service data across the engine fleet and once per-flight transmitted performance measurement from the engine(s) under prognosis. The proposed technique provides predictive results within well defined uncertainty bounds and demonstrates several advantages of the hierarchical variant’s ability to integrate multiple unit data to address realistic prognostic challenges. This is illustrated by an example from a civil aerospace gas turbine fleet data.

TI  - Developing dynamic capabilities in electronic marketplaces: A cross-case study
AU  - Koch, Hope
T2  - The Journal of Strategic Information Systems
AB  - Business-to-business (B2B) electronic marketplaces (EMPs) have increased the efficiency and economy of business purchasing by bringing together a critical mass of organizations that buy and sell goods and services. While many studies have investigated mature EMPs and identified factors leading to their success and failure, few studies have investigated the capabilities necessary to develop successful EMPs. This research shares findings from in-depth case studies of two EMPs conducted over a 3-year period. Using the dynamic capabilities framework as a theoretical lens, this paper: (1) identifies the capabilities necessary to develop EMPs that generate and sustain participant contributions, and (2) discusses how to develop these capabilities. This study finds that the cultivation of a “trial-and-error” culture along with sales managers’ activities played key roles in developing outside-in and spanning capabilities. Taken together these capabilities helped the successful EMP develop entrepreneurial alertness and customer agility, two capabilities that were not developed in the failed EMP. These findings extend dynamic capabilities theory and may help practitioners better develop two-sided networks, such as EMPs, that require a critical mass of buyers and sellers.

TI  - Modern energy access to all in rural India: An integrated implementation strategy
AU  - Balachandra, P.
T2  - Clean Cooking Fuels and Technologies in Developing Economies
AB  - Expanding energy access to the rural population of India presents a critical challenge for its government. The presence of 364 million people without access to electricity and 726 million who rely on biomass for cooking indicate both the failure of past policies and programs, and the need for a radical redesign of the current system. We propose an integrated implementation framework with recommendations for adopting business principles with innovative institutional, regulatory, financing and delivery mechanisms. The framework entails establishment of rural energy access authorities and energy access funds, both at the national and regional levels, to be empowered with enabling regulatory policies, capital resources and the support of multi-stakeholder partnership. These institutions are expected to design, lead, manage and monitor the rural energy interventions. At the other end, trained entrepreneurs would be expected to establish bioenergy-based micro-enterprises that will produce and distribute energy carriers to rural households at an affordable cost. The ESCOs will function as intermediaries between these enterprises and the international carbon market both in aggregating carbon credits and in trading them under CDM. If implemented, such a program could address the challenges of rural energy empowerment by creating access to modern energy carriers and climate change mitigation.

AB  - The paucity of structural defects in carbon nanotube (CNT) with unrivalled mechanical properties has always posed an interest to material scientists for its potential incorporation in soft polymer resins to achieve superior mechanical stability. Present investigation focuses on the assessment of flexural behaviour of glass/epoxy (GE) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) embedded glass/epoxy (0.3 wt. % of epoxy) (CNT-GE) composites at different in-service environmental temperatures. In-situ 3-point bend tests were performed on GE and CNT-GE composites at −80 °C, −40 °C, room temperature (20 °C), 70 °C and 110 °C temperatures at 1 mm/min crosshead speed. The results revealed that at 110 °C temperature, the flexural strength of GE and CNT-GE composites was significantly decreased by 67% and 81% respectively in comparison to their strength at −80 °C temperature. Similarly, 38% and 77% decrement in modulus was noted for GE and CNT-GE composites respectively. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was carried out in the temperature range of −100 °C to 200 °C to correlate the mechanical and thermo-mechanical response of both the material systems. Addition of 0.3 wt. % MWCNT in GE composite resulted in lowering of glass transition temperature (Tg) by 12 °C. Furthermore, to understand various possible deformation and failure mechanisms, the post failure analysis of the fractured specimens, tested at different temperatures, was carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The critical parameters needed during designing composite structures were calculated and modelled using Weibull constitutive model.

AB  - The structural capacity of construction joints in concrete bridges, deck and pavements mainly depends on the bond strength between the old substrate and new overlaid concrete. Sometimes, a mismatch in the properties of old and new concrete may lead to early age failure and shortened service life. Since in 3D concrete printing (3DCP), the whole object is made by layer by layer, bond strength is considered as one of the key parameters to ensure stability in the structure. For understanding bond mechanism, it is essential to measure bond strength at the interface between new and old layer and investigate significant parameters affecting this property. In this direction, our current work targets to analyse tensile bond strength of 3D printed geopolymer mortar with respect to printing time gap between layers, nozzle speed and nozzle standoff distance. A novel formulation of fly ash based geopolymer was made and printed using four-axis automated gantry system. Experimental findings reveal that the bond strength is a function of state of interface material between two nearby layers which can be influenced by material strength development rate and 3D printing parameters.

T2  - Climate change and deforestation: the evolution of an intersecting policy domain
AB  - In the wake of the failures to date of well-publicized multilateral and multi-sectoral mitigation efforts to control greenhouse gases, attention is now increasingly focused on the effectiveness and capacity of national and sub-national level sectoral plans, including forestry, to usher in a new era of adaptation efforts. In Canada, the government of British Columbia spent several years developing its Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative as part of a larger climate change response strategy in the forest sector. Similarly, in the United States, wildfire related events have led to climate change inspired efforts by individual states (e.g., Alaska, California) and the US Forest Service has recently undertaken plans to incorporate climate change considerations in national forest planning beginning with the National Road Map for Responding to Climate Change. This paper highlights a number of shortcomings with both these national and sub-national strategies with respect to the relationships existing between governance, forestry and climate change. It proposes incorporating considerations of governance mechanisms directly into forest sector planning and the need to assess not only natural system level changes but also the extent to which new problems can be dealt with by ‘old’ or ‘new’ governance arrangements.

AB  - The failures of tailings dams, used to store waste from mining operations, pose a significant risk to the health of people and the environment, especially in many low income countries where the extractive industry makes a significant contribution to the nation's wealth. Recently the rate of failure of tailings dams has increased. The demand for raw materials and increases in intense rainfall as a result of climate change will exacerbate this issue in the future. The monitoring of tailings dams is essential to reduce their probability of failure. Virtually all the recent tailings dams failures were preventable. However, there is generally a lack of transparency and accountability for these structures by mining companies. In the past 10 years an increase in the global coverage and accuracy of Earth Observation (EO) based information has made it technically possible to use EO-based data to remotely monitor critical aspects of tailings dams, such as their deformation and the leakage of pollutants. This paper describes the development of an EO-based service, being piloted in Peru, which would allow tailings dams to be monitored cost effectively, and also help to forecast any potentially risk inducing behaviour from tailings dams several weeks in advance. Many regulatory bodies in low income countries do not have the resources to adequately monitor mining operations. A low cost EO-based system could improve the transparency and safety of tailings dams, allowing timely preventative interventions to be made where the probability of failure is found to be high.

The goal of this paper is to integrate simulation modeling along with response surface methodology (RSM) and design of experiments (DOE) in order to analyze and improve the productivity in a selected continuous paint manufacturing industry. Computer simulation is developed to propose different scenarios as the inputs of DOE. Based on the final results, the optimum productivity was achieved at the point of 93.5, that is relevant to the number of labor (B) = 26 and failure time of lifter (C) = 56.01 min. Moreover, the other two factors, A (service rate of delpak mixer) and D (number of permil) should be located at a low level. Quality and production managers, engineers as well as academicians can implement the results of the current study in other case studies. This approach can be generalized to other manufacturing systems to improve their productivity in a timely and cost-effective manner.

TI  - Optimal design of uptime-guarantee contracts under IGFR valuations and convex costs
AU  - Hezarkhani, Behzad
T2  - European Journal of Operational Research
AB  - An uptime-guarantee contract commits a service provider to maintain the functionality of a customer’s equipment at least for certain fraction of working time during a contracted period. This paper addresses the optimal design of uptime-guarantee contracts for the service provider when the customer’s valuation of a contract with a given guaranteed uptime level has an Increasing Generalized Failure Rate (IGFR) distribution. We first consider the case where the service provider proposes only one contract and characterize the optimal contract in terms of price as well as guaranteed uptime level assuming that the service provider’s cost function is convex. In the second part, the case where the service provider offers a menu of contracts is considered. Given the guaranteed uptime levels of different contracts in the menu, we calculate the corresponding optimal prices. We also give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal contract menus with positive expected profits.

AB  - This paper develops an economic production quantity (EPQ) inventory model for a multiproduct single-machine lot-sizing problem with nonconforming items including scrap and rework, where reworks are classified into several groups based on failure severity. In this inventory model, shortage is allowed and is backordered. The aim is to determine the optimal period length, the lot size, and the allowable shortage of each product so as the total cost, including setup, production, warehouse construction, holding, shortage, reworking, and disposal is minimized. Besides, the available total budget is scarce and that there is a lower bound on the service level of each product. While the convexity is proved, an exact method is proposed to solve the nonlinear programming problem. A numerical example is provided at the end to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution procedure as well as to perform a sensitivity analysis.

AB  - When managed properly, social media has been shown to provide clear benefits to organizations. However, social media mismanagement can lead to undesirable situations. This study aims to identify and examine problems associated with social media as its use by an organization evolves. We identify such problems by surveying Canadian organizations. Survey participants were asked to rate the severity of the problems faced by their organization as their social media business profile (SMBP) evolves. Our findings reveal two waves of problems occurring where severity levels increase through the evolution of the SMBP. The most prominent problems are failure to develop metrics for measuring returns on investment and failure to translate data into actionable insights, both of which are related to analytics. We also show that larger organizations tend to experience more strategic problems, while organizations of the service sector experience more severe problems. In identifying the types of problems that emerge and when to expect them during SMBP evolution, this study enables practitioners to anticipate and develop plans that mitigate such problems and to harness the full potential of social media.

AB  - Artificial bodies intentionally placed into low orbit around the earth (LEO) are exposed to critical thermal and mechanical in-service conditions, e.g. severe thermal cycling and micrometeoroid impact. To better understand the response of Glare™-5 2/1 fiber-metal laminate under such conditions, pristine test coupons were subjected to low-energy ballistic impact (21 J) at the temperatures of -196 and 100 °C. Another set of test pieces went through the same experimental conditions, except that they were first submitted to 1,200 thermal shock cycles from -196 to 100 °C. Thermally conditioned specimens exhibited higher resistance to externally visible damage in both test temperatures. On the other hand, internal failure mechanisms characterized via microscopy and X-ray CT inspection techniques have shown that specimens submitted to cryogenic impact after repeated thermal cycling presented the best impact resistance, being age hardening of outer 2024-T3 Al-alloy sheets a possible enhancing factor; besides, residual thermal stresses in the core glass fiber-reinforced epoxy matrix, associated to the post-cure of the latter may have led to higher interlaminar strength.

TI  - The importance of life-cycle based planning in maintenance and energy renovation of multifamily buildings
AU  - Farahani, Abolfazl

T2  - Sustainable Cities and Society
AB  - Improving the energy performance in the real estate sector has become increasingly important and drawn a lot of attention during the past few decades. Despite all the technological developments, the energy efficiency measures are yet expensive and when implemented only to improve the energy performance, are rarely economically justified. To lower the costs of energy performance improvements, an alternative is to combine energy efficiency measures with already required renovation measures. The problem with renovation on the other hand, is that its planning is not strategic; it is mainly opportunistic, short-term and with the focus on the capitalization of newly-discovered opportunities, meaning that renovation measures are coupled when one or more of the rather costly building components have reached failure. The take on an opportunistic approach, however convenient, results in loss of value which is most often neglected in the economic evaluation of renovation projects. The lack of strategic planning and the subsequent loss of value become more important in less-attractive markets, where there are both budget constraints and socio-economic issues. Energy performance and/or living standard are often sacrificed through improper distribution of resources as the choice of renovation measures are often influenced by the return of investment. Therefore, a proper evaluation of renovation alternatives not only can satisfy the technical and financial requirements but also help maintain proper living standard and improve the energy performance in multifamily buildings. In a prior study, authors have proposed a systematic approach to cost-optimal maintenance and renovation planning by combining the deterioration function of building components with respective service-life cycle costing. This paper presents an extension of that methodology to include the energy efficiency option pricing as an optimization criterion. The extended methodology is meant to provide support for housing owners in building management in forms of technical and economic evaluation of possible energy-renovation scenarios under time/budget constraints. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, maintenance/renovation plans are devised for three building components with sharing fixed costs (windows, faöade and roof) in both new and existing multifamily buildings.

T2  - 6th CIRP Global Web Conference – Envisaging the future manufacturing, design, technologies and systems in innovation era (CIRPe 2018)
AB  - The concept of maintenance has advanced significantly over the last decades from a reactive service activity towards a pro-active one with more C-level attention. Among them, predictive maintenance has become a widely used term in industrial arena and academic research. This is being developed constantly by engineers and researchers based on monitoring historical data, modeling, simulation, and failure probabilities to predict fault and system deterioration over their useful life. Generally, the effective lifetime of machines depends on available and accessible data. However, certain unexpected situations may arise that are hard to predict, such as shock damage and unwanted degradation of the tool. Researchers are still working on understanding these problems and their effects on predictive maintenance. This paper presents an overview of condition-based predictive maintenance solutions that aim to avoid unexpected and unplanned failures during the manufacturing and operational process based on advanced data analytics. Furthermore, a brief illustration & discussion is presented on the challenges and opportunities of condition-based predictive maintenance and conclude a summary on future research.

T2  - Computers & Security
AB  - With the increasing role of numerous Internet services, more and more private data must be protected. One of the mechanisms which is used to ensure data security is user authentication. A reliable authentication mechanism is a foundation of security of a remote service but, on the other hand, it is also a source of user frustration because of fear of losing access in case of three failures. A remedy to this problem could be contextual secure authentication. Such a protocol should provide multi-level authentication mechanism which increases user satisfaction without decreasing a protection level. In this paper we propose a risk analysis procedure of a new authentication management model using contextual data and oriented on user experience. We describe an approach to risk assessment of the mechanism, which supports a process of choosing the proper multi-step authentication procedure. On this basis, it is possible to provide a security solution which keeps balance between user satisfaction (related to QoE) and the obtained Level of Security (related to QoP).

AB  - M&S plays a key role in ensuring the success of innovative systems, which meet existing needs or introduce new standards, by disrupting the status quo. In last decades the technological evolution offered the opportunity to broaden the fields of application of digital equipment, making them ubiquitous. Giving examples of this is almost pointless, since everyone observes the evolution of the “classic” products into new products, which very often result from the hybridization of different devices. Cell phones are an obvious example. Nowadays besides voice communication services, they offer other forms of communicating as well as a myriad of other features. However, innovations have some risk of failure associated to them, for many different reasons. Acceptability of a product depends on a host of attributes which include cost, reliability, and usefulness. This work will address how M&S can be used to improve the support to the decision processes to define why systems are needed, what the best implementation alternatives are, and how to develop, operate and sustain them in an effective and efficient way. The discussion will focus the domain of defense systems, considering the characteristics and requirements of the different life cycle stages.

T2  - Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review
AB  - Much has been written about the potential of technologies to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of trucking, but much less on the determinants of these investments. The Trucking Sector Trip Segmentation Model (TSTS) predicts how firms make these investments in the context of operating heterogeneous truck fleets to service the spatially dispersed demand of shippers. This analysis suggests that improving the performance of trucking (speeding up shipments) could reduce significantly GHG emissions: investments in technologies are incentivized by fuel savings accruing sooner. This effect could be potentially large in the US as trucking firms often discount the future heavily.

AB  - Italy reformed its water and sanitation services in 1994. The strategy aimed at transforming public entities, financed by the central budget, into self-sufficient professional companies regulated at arms' length. Nearly 20 years after, the reform has failed to deliver (despite some partial success). Italians have been divided in two parties: those blaming public sector inefficiencies and calling for competitive tendering; and those refusing to privatize water and willing to go back to the fiscal budget. In this article, we suggest that both parties are wrong. Underperformance is not related to the ownership structure of water companies, but rather to poor regulatory design and lack of understanding of the regulatory requirements that are implicit in the management model chosen, namely the concession contract.

T2  - Polymer Degradation and Stability
AB  - Organically modified clay – reinforced hydrogenated nitrile rubber vulcanizate was subjected to accelerated heat aging to estimate its long-term thermo-oxidative stability and its useful lifetime was compared with that of the virgin polymer for the first time. Changes in technical properties such as tensile strength, modulus and elongation at break were studied as a function of time and temperature of aging. The infrared spectroscopic analysis of the degraded products revealed that under aerobic hot aging conditions, hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR) compounds undergo cross-linking reactions that lead to embrittlement and ultimately failure. Incorporation of clay filler, however, resulted in significant improvement of the degradation profile of the nanocomposite at elevated temperatures. Loss of ductility during aging of the nanocomposite was also milder, relative to the unfilled polymer, indicating a restricted degradation by the clay filled rubber, thus prolonging the durability. From the scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies, it was found that nanofillers protected the elastomer from surface rupture that took place on oxidation. Life prediction of both virgin elastomer and the nanocomposite indicated a three-fold increase in the effective service temperature range of the HNBR using 8 parts organically modified nanoclay.

T2  - Expert Systems with Applications
AB  - Today, new services creation is very crucial for RFID (radio frequency identification) products manufacturers. A newly successful RFID application can enhance their change in organization and to manage growth in an increasingly competitive environment. But, there is a high failure rate in new products development processes. Thus, RFID manufacturers need an effective tool to assist them to create novel RFID product functions. This study proposes a newly systematic approach called QT-Kano model which integrates three management tools, quality function deployment (QFD), the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), and a refined Kano’s model, to create new product functions of RFID products. In QT-Kano model, QFD has firstly been used to transform customer demands into engineering quality characteristics. Secondly, based on the contradiction relationship between those engineering quality characteristics, the novel designed functions are created by TRIZ. Finally, to reduce the high failure rate in new products development processes, a refined Kano’s model are applied to offer a better understanding from customer’s viewpoint and to assist service designers focusing on the most important attributes that need to be improved. A real case of RFID product function development is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

T2  - Information Sciences
AB  - This paper aims to enhance the reliability and quality of service (QoS) of power smart grids by searching and applying reconfiguration oriented solutions. A novel definition of recovery performance is provided in terms of automatic recoverability and unavailability rates. The proposed approach is based on a hierarchical and distributed multi-agent system (MAS). It involves static and mobile agents, respectively, dedicated to search for new feasible reconfigurations and to identify the consumers which may play the role of feeders over smart grids. An automatic reconfiguration corresponds to the addition of a new pertinent line in a smart grid to allow further recoveries. This paper provides the implemented communication protocol for negotiating (CPN) the resources allocation which is performed by the deployed agents. The management and assignment of the energy resources are modeled as a combinatorial optimization multiple-knapsack problem (MKP) to reach a better configuration with a higher possible recovery performance rate. To decrease the cost of automatic actions, which increases the smart grid performance and reduces the costs of the human interventions, a short list of failures is identified based on proposed relations of dominance and equivalence between observed failures. Furthermore, this work investigates the effectiveness of the designed and implemented software tool for off-line assistance-design, simulation and modeling of reconfigurable smart grids. The efficiency of the proposed strategy is validated through an experimental study performed by the developed simulator.

AB  - Industrial cyber-physical systems are the primary enabling technology for Industry 4.0, which combine legacy industrial and control engineering, with emerging technology paradigms (e.g. big data, internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning), to derive self-aware and self-configuring factories capable of delivering major production innovations. However, the technologies and architectures needed to connect and extend physical factory operations to the cyber world have not been fully resolved. Although cloud computing and service-oriented architectures demonstrate strong adoption, such implementations are commonly produced using information technology perspectives, which can overlook engineering, control and Industry 4.0 design concerns relating to real-time performance, reliability or resilience. Hence, this research compares the latency and reliability performance of cyber-physical interfaces implemented using traditional cloud computing (i.e. centralised), and emerging fog computing (i.e. decentralised) paradigms, to deliver real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications for Industry 4.0. The findings highlight that despite the cloud’s highly scalable processing capacity, the fog’s decentralised, localised and autonomous topology may provide greater consistency, reliability, privacy and security for Industry 4.0 engineering applications, with the difference in observed maximum latency ranging from 67.7%–99.4%. In addition, communication failures rates highlighted differences in both consistency and reliability, with the fog interface successfully responding to 900,000 communication requests (i.e. 0% failure rate), and the cloud interface recording failure rates of 0.11%, 1.42%, and 6.6% under varying levels of stress.

T2  - Diversity of Child Health Care in Europe: A Study of the European Paediatric Association/Union of National European Paediatric Societies and Associations
AB  - The health of children and adolescents of Armenia has been affected by various socioeconomic, environmental, educational, and behavioral factors, demonstrating trends typical for both developed and developing countries. Key issues to be addressed by Armenian pediatricians are child mortality, malnutrition, and growth failure in the early years and overweight in later years. The case of Armenia illustrates how countries in transition are currently tackling both “old” problems (mortality and malnutrition) and “new” emerging morbidities (chronic diseases and adolescent health problems) based on social and health determinants, but the financing of the health system is far from satisfactory. Lessons of Armenia indicate the need for more cooperation between general practitioners and pediatricians at a primary care level. In addition, a better balance between inpatient and outpatient care could be achieved, which is not yet the case. Nevertheless, the overall performance of the Armenian child health care system can be considered satisfactory when bearing in mind the limitation of resources. Among the successful factors are those inherited from the Soviet period health system, including key institutions such as rural health posts and health centers, city polyclinics, and hospitals. These institutions mostly meet the needs of Armenian children and families today.

AB  - The biopharmaceutical industry is increasingly interested in moving from batch to semi-continuous manufacturing processes. These continuous bioprocesses are more failure-prone and process failure is more consequential. In addition, the probability of failure is dependent on process run time which generally is determined independent of scheduling considerations. This work presents a discrete-event simulation of continuous bioprocesses in a scheduling environment. Dynamic scheduling policies are investigated to make operational decisions in a multi-product manufacturing facility and react to process failure events and uncertain demand. First, different scheduling policies are adapted from the stochastic lot sizing literature and a novel look-ahead scheduling policy is proposed. Then, policy parameters (including process run time) are tuned using evolutionary algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the tuned policies perform much better than a policy that estimates policy parameters based on service level considerations and a policy based on a fixed cyclical sequence.

TI  - Bridging the industrial energy efficiency gap – Assessing the evidence from the Italian white certificate scheme
AU  - Stede, Jan
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The Italian white certificate scheme is the main national policy instrument to incentivise energy efficiency of the industrial sector, with savings from white certificates amounting to 2% of Italy's 2012 primary energy consumption. The mechanism sets binding energy-saving targets on electricity and gas distributors with at least 50,000 clients and includes a voluntary opt-in model for participation from other parties. This paper investigates and assesses the elements of the scheme that help overcome several barriers to deliver industrial energy efficiency. Results from a survey conducted among leading experts indicate that the Italian system provides a strong financial incentive to energy efficiency investments, covering a significant share of investment costs and thus reducing payback time. Moreover, the scheme fosters the development of energy service companies (ESCOs), which are key to developing, installing and arranging finance for projects on the ground. In conjunction with other policies, the mechanism also raises awareness of energy efficiency investment opportunities, thus helping overcome the market failure of insufficient information. Core challenges remain, including tackling regulatory uncertainty and improving access to finance.

TI  - Privatisation, empowerment and accountability: What are the policy implications for establishing effective farmer organisations?
AU  - Mbeche, Robert M.
AU  - Dorward, Peter
T2  - Land Use Policy
AB  - Weak institutional development and information flows have constrained the extent to which the smallholder farming sector in developing countries can significantly drive growth and poverty reduction. This is despite widely implemented economic liberalisation policies focussing on market efficiency. Farmer organisations are viewed as a potential means of addressing public and private institutional failure but this has frequently been limited by inequalities in access to power and information. This article investigates two issues that have received little research attention to date: what role downward accountability plays in enabling farmer organisations to improve services and markets, and what influences the extent to which downward accountability is achieved. Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), one of the largest farmer organisations in the world (>400,000 farmers) is examined alongside wider literature. Mixed methods were used including key informant interviews, and eight months of participant observation followed by a questionnaire survey. The article concludes that without effective downward accountability farmer organisations can become characterised by institutions and mechanisms that favour elites, restricted weak coordination and regulation, and manipulated information flows. This in turn reduces individuals’ incentives to invest. If farmer organisations are to realise their potential as a means of enabling the smallholder sector to significantly contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction, policy and research needs to address key factors which influence accountability including: how to ensure initial processes in formation of farmer organisations establish appropriate structures and rules; strong state regulation to enhance corporate accountability; transparent information provision regarding actions of farmer organisation leaders; and the role independent non-government organisations can play. Consequently attention needs to focus on developing means of legitimising rights, building poor people's capacity to challenge exclusion, and moving from rights to obligations regarding information provision.

T2  - International Conference “Large-scale Crises: 1929 vs. 2008”
AB  - The global financial and economic crisis, which began in late 2007 (Great Recession) is the worst international crisis since 1929 (Great Depression), and still affects many countries. This paper attempts to determine if the theory of “extended crises” presented by Delli Gatti et al. (2012) is consistent with empirical evidence. The analysis is carried out using two approaches. The first part of the paper is purely descriptive and is dedicated to a comparison between structural differences and different patterns of development in six countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and US. Using data on the major world economies (KLEMS and STAN) since 1970, we show that the fundamentals behind the “extended crisis theory” apply to these economies. We focus particularly on Italy, Germany and the US. Among large economies, Italy is one of the most affected and still not recovering, even though the Italian financial sector appeared to have been less exposed to the 2008 shock than other countries. The crisis in Italy could be directly connected to the failure of the Italian economy to move to an economic system based on more skill-intensive production, in particular in the service sector (as in the US). The US financial sector was extremely exposed to the 2008 sub-prime crisis but US economy recovered much faster than in many European countries. Germany is the leading European economy, generally considered in European public debate as the example to be followed. In the last part of the paper the analysis is broadened, involving more countries in a panel analysis approach: different specifications of panel probit/logit models are presented, in a first attempt to investigate the roles of both structural features and financial shock in explaining the extent of the crisis in different countries.

AB  - Information systems play a crucial role in most of today’s business operations. High availability and reliability of services and hardware, and, in the case of outages, short response times are essential. Thus, a high amount of tool support and automation in risk management is desirable to decrease downtime. We propose a new approach for calculating the root cause for an observed failure in an IT infrastructure. Our approach is based on abduction in Markov Logic Networks. Abduction aims to find an explanation for a given observation in the light of some background knowledge. In failure diagnosis, the explanation corresponds to the root cause, the observation to the failure of a component, and the background knowledge to the dependency graph extended by potential risks. We apply a method to extend a Markov Logic Network in order to conduct abductive reasoning, which is not naturally supported in this formalism. Our approach exhibits a high amount of reusability and facilitates modeling by using ontologies as background knowledge. This enables users without specific knowledge of a concrete infrastructure to gain viable insights in the case of an incident. We implemented the method in a tool and illustrate its suitability for root cause analysis by applying it to a sample scenario and testing its scalability on randomly generated infrastructures.

AU  - Rolón, Milagros

T2  - Computers & Industrial Engineering
AB  - In enterprise networks, companies interact on a temporal basis through client–server relationships between order agents (clients) and resource agents (servers) acting as autonomic managers. In this work, the autonomic MES (@MES) proposed by Rolón and Martinez (2012) has been extended to allow selfish behavior and adaptive decision-making in distributed execution control and emergent scheduling. Agent learning in the @MES is addressed by rewarding order agents in order to continuously optimize their processing routes based on cost and reliability of alternative resource agents (servers). Service providers are rewarded so as to learn the quality level corresponding to each task which is used to define the processing time and cost for each client request. Two reinforcement learning algorithms have been implemented to simulate learning curves of client–server relationships in the @MES. Emerging behaviors obtained through generative simulation in a case study show that despite selfish behavior and policy adaptation in order and resource agents, the autonomic MES is able to reject significant disturbances and handle unplanned events successfully.

T2  - Sustainability of biofuels
AB  - Energy autarky is presented as a conceptual framework for implementing sustainable regional development based on the transformation of the energy subsystem. It is conceptualized as a situation in which the energy services used for sustaining local consumption, local production and the export of goods and services are derived from locally renewable energy resources. Technically, the implementation of higher degrees of energy autarky rests on increasing energy efficiency, realizing the potential of renewable energy resources and relying on a decentralized energy system. Practically, a transition towards regional energy autarky requires administrations and civil society actors to initialize and develop projects at the local level, ensure their acceptance and support by the regional population and implement the project in collaboration with relevant actors. Besides the description of the concept and the benefits its implementation brings, this article provides a process for implementation, and some examples from Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

AB  - Rural Internet kiosks in developing regions can cost-effectively provide communication and information services to the poorest sections of society. Yet, a variety of technical and non-technical issues have caused most kiosk deployments to be economically unsustainable. KioskNet addresses the key technical problems underlying kiosk failure by using robust ‘mechanical backhaul’ for connectivity, and by using low-cost and reliable kiosk controllers to support services delivered from one or more recycled PCs. KioskNet also addresses related issues such as security, user management, and log collection. In this paper, we describe the KioskNet system, outlining its hardware, software, and security architecture. We describe a pilot deployment and how we used lessons from this deployment to re-design our initial prototype.

AU  - Leurent, Fabien

T2  - Special Issue: Towards Efficient and Reliable Transportation Systems
AB  - The paper provides a novel network model of parking and route choice. Parking supply is represented by parking type, management strategy including the fare, capacity and occupancy rate of parking lot, and network location, in relation to access routes along the roadway network. Trip demand is segmented according to origin–destination pair, the disposal of private parking facilities and the individual preferences for parking quality of service. Each traveller is assumed to make a two stage choice of, first, network route on the basis of the expected cost of route and parking and, second, local diversion on the basis of a discrete choice model. Search circuits are explicitly considered on the basis of the success probability to get a slot at a given lot and of the transition probabilities between lots in case of failure. The basic endogenous model variables are the route flows, the lot success probabilities and the transition probabilities between lots. These give rise to the cost of a travel route up to a target lot and to the expected cost of search and park from that lot to the destination. Traffic equilibrium is defined in a static setting. It is characterized by a mixed problem of variational inequality and fixed point. Equilibrium is shown to exist under mild conditions and a Method of Successive Averages is put forward to solve for it. Lastly, a planning instance is given to illustrate the effects of insufficient parking capacity on travel costs and network flows.

T2  - International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives
AB  - Thermal cycling is one of the representative service environments of automobiles. As epoxy adhesive and resin matrix of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) composites are polymer materials, their properties may change during long-term thermal cycling and thus affect the joint strength of adhesively bonded composites joints. To investigate the degradation mechanism of adhesively bonded CFRP/aluminum alloy joints subjected to thermal cycling, firstly, the chemical transformations of adhesive and CFRP were analyzed by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and TG/DTG (Thermal Gravimetric/Differential Thermal Gravimetric), and changes in mechanical properties of adhesive and CFRP were also tested by quasi-static tests. Then the variations of failure strength and failure modes of adhesively bonded CFRP/aluminum alloy shear joints and butt joints after different aging time were investigated. Results show that the Tg (glass transition temperature), thermal stability, failure strength and Young's modulus of adhesive improved after thermal cycling because of post-curing. The Tg and thermal stability of the CFRP decreased due to surface oxidation, resulting in the decline of surface adhesiveness of CFRP and the appearance of interface failure. Besides, the mechanical performance of the fiber/matrix interface also declined after thermal cycling, which was verified by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). The failure strength of shear and butt joints dropped by more than 40% after thermal cycling for 30 days. The degradation of shear joints was mainly caused by the combined effect of thermal stress and post-curing of adhesive as well as interface failure, while the butt joints were also affected by the fiber tear of CFRP.

AB  - Background
Despite the wide gap between the developed and developing world in terms of ICT access, ICT investment in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) has increased due to the rapid development of mobile services. However, the effects of ICTs in LMICs remain debatable.
Methods
An online survey was conducted to collect feedback from experts. The questionnaire explored the role of ICTs in the economic development of LMICs, investigated the benefits and limits of e-health, and collected evaluations of past EU initiatives on future development policies. Structured interviews were also carried out with ten of the respondents.
Results
One hundred and forty-five experts responded to the survey. Health and education were considered to be the two main areas where ICTs can support economic development. Poor infrastructure, lack of political support and human capital, and poor affordability were found to be the main obstacles. The shortcomings of donors in fostering the role of ICTs in LMICs development were identified as sustainability of interventions and lack of a coherent approach. The main benefits of e-health technologies in LMICs are their ability to facilitate health information and increase access to health care. Remote data collection, training for healthcare workers and education are the most effective m-health applications. Poor infrastructure and lack of equipment are considered the main barriers to the use of e-health in LMICs. Limited financial resources and lack of policy and regulatory frameworks might prevent the scaling up of e-health.
Conclusions
The results of this survey can support decision makers and healthcare managers to better plan and implement ICTs in LMICs and make improved use of European resources for development.

AB  - We study real-time demand fulfillment for networks consisting of multiple local warehouses, where spare parts of expensive technical systems are kept on stock for customers with different service contracts. Each service contract specifies a maximum response time in case of a failure and hourly penalty costs for contract violations. Part requests can be fulfilled from multiple local warehouses via a regular delivery, or from an external source with ample capacity via an expensive emergency delivery. The objective is to minimize delivery cost and penalty cost by smartly allocating items from the available network stock to arriving part requests. We propose a dynamic allocation rule that belongs to the class of one-step lookahead policies. To approximate the optimal relative cost, we develop an iterative calculation scheme that estimates the expected total cost over an infinite time horizon, assuming that future demands are fulfilled according to a simple static allocation rule. In a series of numerical experiments, we compare our dynamic allocation rule with the optimal allocation rule, and a simple but widely used static allocation rule. We show that the dynamic allocation rule has a small optimality gap and that it achieves an average cost reduction of 7.9% compared to the static allocation rule on a large test bed containing problem instances of real-life size.

AB  - The complexity of modern day power grid is increasing with penetration of large-scale renewable resources at various levels of the networks. Inclusion of communication networks, to facilitate data transfer for ensuring reliability and security of the power system, with the electricity network extends the complexity to a new scale in a contemporary smart power grid. Any error in the integrated communication network can propagate through the electricity grid initiating large-scale cascading outages. Extensive precautionary measures should be taken in order to avoid such catastrophe. Complex network theory has been very useful in identifying critical components within the system as well as modelling of cascading failures. Complex network theory based percolation methods have been proved to be very useful in assessing power grid vulnerability under random and targeted attacks. In this paper, we extend our network percolation based analysis to explore the functional vulnerability of the existing electricity grid, effect on grid service efficiency, of increasing penetration of renewable energy. Vulnerable regions are identified with a fast computer simulation which helps operators to take quick preventive measures in case of emergency. Various standard IEEE test systems are simulated to test the applicability of the proposed algorithm in a real power system.

T2  - European Journal of Operational Research
AB  - We consider a problem in which a firm dynamically prices a product and its warranty service over time. Consumers can learn about the reliability of products based on warranty prices. A firm’s optimal product and warranty pricing policies are characterized. We find that a warranty should be priced lower than the marginal warranty service cost, which implies that warranty sales will not generate profits directly. However, offering a modest warranty still benefits the firm’s overall profits. We also show that consumers’ beliefs and the firm’s warranty policy converge in the long run. In a steady state, either a fraction of consumers will purchase a warranty or no consumer will purchase a warranty. Comparative statics analysis is conducted to show how factors such as a firm’s warranty service cost, consumers’ learning speed, and the heterogeneity of consumers’ handling costs determine consumers’ beliefs, the firm’s warranty policy and profitability in a steady state. Lastly, we note that a firm benefits from consumer learning by hiding the information about the true product reliability only when the true product failure rate is relatively high.

Public transport congestion leads to crowding discomfort, denied boardings and lower service reliability. However, transit assignment models and appraisal methodologies usually do not account for the dynamics of public transport congestion and crowding and thus potentially underestimate the related benefits. This study develops a method to capture the benefits of increased capacity by using a dynamic and stochastic transit assignment model. Using an agent-based public transport simulation model, we dynamically model the evolution of network reliability and on-board crowding. The model is embedded in a comprehensive framework for project appraisal. A case study of a metro extension that partially replaces an overloaded bus network in Stockholm demonstrates that congestion effects may account for a substantial share of the expected benefits. A cost-benefit analysis based on a conventional static model will miss more than a third of the benefits. This suggests that failure to represent dynamic congestion effects may substantially underestimate the benefits of projects, especially if they are primarily intended to increase capacity rather than to reduce travel times.

AB  - Maintenance and its cost continue, over the years, to draw the attention of production management since the unplanned failures decrease the reliability of the system and also the return of investments. Advanced maintenance techniques that capture and process shop-floor information can reduce costs and increase the sustainability of an enterprise. This paper presents a condition-based preventive maintenance approach integrated into a machine monitoring framework. The latter acquires data from shop-floor machine tools and analyses them through an information fusion technique to support the condition-based preventive maintenance operations. The proposed approach is developed into a software service, deployed on a Cloud environment. The service gathers and processes data, such as their actual processing time and machining time per tool, related to the operation of machine tools and equipment and calculates the expected remaining useful life of components. Moreover, it provides notifications to machine tool operators and maintenance departments, as well as it enables the communication among them using mobile technology. The framework is applied to a case study with data obtained from a machining SME.

AB  - The objective of this research is to advice the Municipality of The Hague whether, if and under which conditions, the implementation of an Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) is possible and desirable. To determine factors that caused the success or failure of UCCs in practice, a survey of 6 cases in Europe is conducted. The cases were selected because of the similarity of the service area of the UCC and the city centre of The Hague or because of the uniqueness of the UCC. To determine the possible success for a UCC in The Hague four scenarios are evaluated. Two major difficulties with implementing the UCC are the allocation of the costs and benefits and the willingness to cooperate of the transportation companies. Both consignees and transportation companies can benefit financially from using the UCC. The UCC operator, however, incurs the costs. The municipality should play a role in bringing the costs and benefits together.

AB  - Health systems in many African countries are failing to provide populations with access to good quality health care. Morbidity and mortality from curable diseases such as malaria remain high. The PRIME trial in Tororo, rural Uganda, designed and tested an intervention to improve care at health centres, with the aim of reducing ill-health due to malaria in surrounding communities. This paper presents the impact and context of this trial from the perspective of community members in the study area. Fieldwork was carried out for a year from the start of the intervention in June 2011, and involved informal observation and discussions as well as 13 focus group discussions with community members, 10 in-depth interviews with local stakeholders, and 162 context descriptions recorded through quarterly interviews with community members, health workers and district officials. Community members observed a small improvement in quality of care at most, but not all, intervention health centres. However, this was diluted by other shortfalls in health services beyond the scope of the intervention. Patients continued to seek care at health centres they considered inadequate as well as positioning themselves and their children to access care through other sources such as research and nongovernmental organization (NGO) projects. These findings point to challenges of designing and delivering interventions within a paradigm that requires factorial (reduced to predictable factors) problem definition with easily actionable and evaluable solutions by small-scale projects. Such requirements mean that interventions often work on the periphery of a health system rather than tackling the murky political and economic realities that shape access to care but are harder to change or evaluate with randomized controlled trials. Highly projectified settings further reduce the ability to genuinely ‘control’ for different health care access scenarios. We argue for a raised consciousness of how evaluation paradigms impact on intervention choices.

TI  - Payment Systems in Economy - Present End Future Tendencies
AU  - Gogoski, Risto
T2  - XI International Conference, Service Sector in Terms of Changing Environment, 27-29 October 2011, Ohrid
AB  - A payment system is no more than an organized arrangement for transferring value between its participants. So defined, it is clear that payment systems are fundamental to the functioning of all monetary economies, no matter they are developed economies, transitional economies, or developing economies. The aim of this work is to show how the architecture of payment systems (payment instruments, processing, participants and etc) influence to payment industry (microeconomic approach) and for the role of central bank in payment systems (macroeconomic - public approach). We use the method of qualitative analyse, not empirical measures. Central banks, as issuers of money, have always had a keen interest in the smooth functioning of the national payment system and the way it affects the economy. Their involvement has, however, evolved over time, as central banks have increasingly taken on a prominent role in the pursuit of the public good of maintaining trust in the currency and ensuring its smooth circulation. Consequently, their involvement in payment, clearing and settlement has changed. Also, the aim of this work is to paint a broad-brush picture of the economic links between central banks and payments in the present and the future. We research contemporary trends that affecting the role of the central bank, and trends in the future. In the work we offer some ideas about the future direction of payments and central bank involvement in payment systems. We also explore the implications for the ability of central banks to carry out their core monetary and financial stability functions in the future trough the payment systems.

AU  - Lo, Huai-Wei

T2  - Applied Soft Computing
AB  - Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a forward-looking risk-management technique used in various industries for promoting the reliability and safety of products, processes, structures, systems, and services. However, FMEA has many defects in practical experimentation. Therefore, this paper proposes a new model that uses multiple-criteria decision-making in combination with grey theory for FMEA. This approach has several advantages, such as being able to add the expected cost into the original risk priority number (RPN) to reflect the actual resource limitations, consider the different weights of severity, occurrence, detectability, and cost based on the best–worst method in RPN element calculation, and use the grey interval linguistic variables to manage information uncertainty. Furthermore, this study applied probability-based grey relational analysis to calculate the RPN, which preserves the information of prioritized failure modes through interval analysis. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model, real data from an international electronics company were applied. The proposed model can provide an alternative risk priority solution for product development.

AB  - In a turbulent world, global competition and the uncertainty of markets have led organizations and technology to evolve exponentially, surpassing the most imaginary scenarios predicted at the beginning of the digital manufacturing era, in the 1980s. Business paradigms have changed from a standalone vision into complex and collaborative ecosystems where enterprises break down organizational barriers to improve synergies with others and become more competitive. In this context, paired with networking and enterprise integration, enterprise information systems (EIS) interoperability gained utmost importance, ensuring an increasing productivity and efficiency thanks to a promise of more automated information exchange in networked enterprises scenarios. However, EIS are also becoming more dynamic. Interfaces that are valid today are outdated tomorrow, thus static interoperability enablers and communication software services are no longer the solution for the future. This paper is focused on the challenge of sustaining networked EIS interoperability, and takes up input from solid research initiatives in the areas of knowledge management and model driven development, to propose and discuss several research strategies and technological trends towards next EIS generation.

AB  - Polycarbonate (PC) is an engineering polymer which presents interesting properties. This material has been also used in medical devices, which is frequently exposed to gamma radiosterilization and to chemical agents. This may produce significant changes in polymer structure, leading to failure in service. The present work brings about a new approach on environmental stress cracking (ESC) processes elucidation in 100kGy gamma-irradiated PC, by evaluating the diffusion process of methanol or 2-propanol in test specimens and determining the diffusion parameters on solvent-irradiated polymer systems. A comparison of diffusion parameters for both solvents indicated that methanol has a considerable ESC action on PC, with diffusion parameter of 7.5×10−14±1%m2s−1 for non-irradiated PC and 7.8×10−14±2.8%m2s−1 for PC irradiated at 100kGy. In contrast, 2-propanol did not act as an ESC agent, as it did promote neither swelling nor cracks in the test specimens. These results were confirmed by visual analysis and optical microscopy. Unexpectedly, structural damages evidenced in tensile strength tests suggested that 2-propanol is as aggressive as methanol chemical for PC. Moreover, although some manufacturers indicate the use of 2-propanol as a cleaning product for PC artifacts, such use should be avoided in parts under mechanical stress.

T2  - Transport Policy
AB  - This paper provides a broader understanding of seaport choice. There has been considerable expansion in international maritime container based trade that is requiring substantial investment in seaport capacity. The growth in demand for port services has, however, neither been even over time nor across ports making the defining of appropriate investment policies challenging. Most studies of port choice, a major factor in the demand for any individual port, focus on relatively easily quantified measures, such as financial costs, to the neglect of less tangible factors that also influence decision-making. Here we examine the role played by subjective factors, namely the preference rates in port choice, by focusing on the optimal port of call of shipping lines serving South-east Asian and European ports drawing upon trade-offs between generalized costs and preference rates. An analytic hierarchy process is employed to ascertain the subjective element. The findings confirm that subjectivity does matter in influencing port choice, and thus failure to incorporate it in policy-making can involve leaving out an important element in the management of port investment and financing.

AU  - Li, Xiaopeng

T2  - 20th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT 2013)
AB  - This paper proposes a new modeling method that transforms an infrastructure system with interdependent and correlated facility failures into an equivalent one with an explicit supporting structure. This structure consists of a set of supporting stations that are subject to only independent disruptions with identified probabilities, and thus is much easier to characterize and formulate. Such a supporting structure framework is capable of not only providing a mathematical representation of complex facility failure mechanisms but also physically emulating interdependent infrastructures and their inter-connections in many real-world systems. We examine the properties of this structure and find that it can be used to model a range of heterogeneous and correlated facility failure patterns. A mathematical model built on the supporting structure is created to solve reliable facility location design problems under correlated facility failure risks. This model determines the optimal locations for supporting stations and service facilities to minimize the total system cost including infrastructure investment in the early planning stage and the expected transportation costs and service-loss penalties during the operational stage. This model is formulated into a compact integer linear program and can be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art solvers. A set of experiments and case studies are conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and to draw managerial insights into the optimal system design.

T2  - Expert Systems with Applications
AB  - E-procurement has become an important function of enterprise information systems. The process of e-procurement includes the automatic definition of product requirements, search and selection for suppliers, negotiation and contracting with suppliers. However, the adoption of e-procurement encounters various exceptions from internal and external environments such as sharply increased demand, delivery delay and inventory failure. In this paper, we have proposed an agent and Web service based architecture for exception handling in e-procurement. Agent technology is applied to deal with the complex, dynamic, and distributed e-procurement process, while Web service technology is applied to provide scalability and interoperability. In this architecture, different tasks in the e-procurement process, such as searching, negotiating, supplier selection, contracting, monitoring, and exception handling, are assigned to different agents, which are wrapped as Web services. A set of rules for detecting and handling the exceptions is defined based on a basic inventory model and a genetic algorithm is utilized for supplier selection. To evaluate our exception handling approach, we have developed a prototype system, through which a simulation has been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - The negative word-of-month (NWOM) contained in comments posted on online forums can have significant effects on consumer purchase decisions. Despite this, the related corporate response strategies and their effects have not been investigated in depth. For this reason, this study examined the effects of different response strategies and the severity of failure on customer attribution in relation to NWOM. It also examined the relationships among customer attribution, organizational reputation, and NWOM. The results indicate that response strategies and severity of failure affect customer attribution, and that these have negative relationships with organizational reputation and positive relationships with NWOM. Severity of failure is likewise found to be an element influencing customer attribution in addition to response strategies, and the negative relationship between customer attribution and organizational reputation is verified. This study suggests that managers in service industries can adopt accommodative strategies and attempt to prevent severe failures so as to improve customer perceptions of organizational reputation, thereby reducing their desire to engage in NWOM.

Whilst on the one hand fine physical simulation allows predicting accurately failure occurrences or manoeuvre consequences, and on the other hand fine behavioural models allow apprehending the services expected from a given system as an organisation of functions performed by various agents, it is difficult to have both approaches work together. This paper proposes a bridge between both approaches by developing a model describing in a unified way dependencies, redundancies, and interactions between physical components concurring to ensure elementary functions of a system, and shows how this approach was applied to the assessment of remedial measures to space debris issues for space assets.

AB  - The French Space Agency (CNES) is currently operating thirteen satellites among which five remote sensing satellites. This fleet is composed of two civilian (SPOT) and three military (HELIOS) satellites and it has been recently completed by the first PLEIADES satellite which is devoted to both civil and military purposes. The CNES operation board decided to appoint a Working Group (WG) in order to anticipate and tackle issues related to the emergency End Of Life (EOL) operations due to unexpected on-board events affecting the satellite. This is of particular interest in the context of the French Law on Space Operations (LSO), entered in force on Dec. 2010, which states that any satellite operator must demonstrate its capability to control the space vehicle whatever the mission phase from the launch up to the EOL. Indeed, after several years in orbit the satellites may be affected by on-board anomalies which could damage the implementation of EOL operations, i.e. orbital manoeuvres or platform disposal. Even if automatic recovery actions ensure autonomous reconfigurations on redundant equipment, i.e. setting for instance the satellite into a safe mode, it is crucial to anticipate the consequences of failures of every equipment and functions necessary for the EOL operations. For this purpose, the WG has focused on each potential anomaly by analysing: its emergency level, as well as the EOL operations potentially inhibited by the failure and the needs of on-board software workarounds… The main contribution of the WG consisted in identifying a particular satellite configuration called “minimal Withdrawal From Service (WFS) configuration”. This configuration corresponds to an operational status which involves a redundancy necessary for the EOL operations. Therefore as soon as a satellite reaches this state, a dedicated steering committee is activated and decides of the future of the satellite with respect to three options: a/. the satellite is considered safe and can continue its mission using the redundancy, b/. the EOL operations must be planned within a mid-term period, or c/. the EOL operations must be implemented as soon as possible by the operational teams. The paper describes this management and operational process illustrated with study cases of failures on SPOT and PLEIADES satellites corresponding to various emergency situations.

T2  - Transportation Research Part B: Methodological
AB  - This paper studies a reliable joint inventory-location problem that optimizes facility locations, customer allocations, and inventory management decisions when facilities are subject to disruption risks (e.g., due to natural or man-made hazards). When a facility fails, its customers may be reassigned to other operational facilities in order to avoid the high penalty costs associated with losing service. We propose an integer programming model that minimizes the sum of facility construction costs, expected inventory holding costs and expected customer costs under normal and failure scenarios. We develop a Lagrangian relaxation solution framework for this problem, including a polynomial-time exact algorithm for the relaxed nonlinear subproblems. Numerical experiment results show that this proposed model is capable of providing a near-optimum solution within a short computation time. Managerial insights on the optimal facility deployment, inventory control strategies, and the corresponding cost constitutions are drawn.

AB  - Cellular networks serve a critical role during and immediately after a hurricane, allowing citizens to contact emergency services when land-line communication is lost and serving as a backup communication channel for emergency responders. However, due to their ubiquitous deployment and limited design for extreme loading events, basic network elements, such as cellular towers and antennas are prone to failures during adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes. Accordingly, a systematic and computationally feasible approach is required for assessing and improving the reliability of cellular networks during hurricanes. In this paper we develop a new multi-disciplinary approach to efficiently and accurately assess cellular network reliability during hurricanes. We show how the performance of a cellular network during and immediately after future hurricanes can be estimated based on a combination of hurricane wind field models, structural reliability analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and cellular network models and simulation tools. We then demonstrate the use of this approach for assessing the improvement in system reliability that can be achieved with discrete topological changes in the system. Our results suggest that adding redundancy, particularly through a mesh topology or through the addition of an optical fiber ring around the perimeter of the system can be an effective way to significantly increase the reliability of some cellular systems during hurricanes.

T2  - Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing
AB  - A distributed video-on-demand system (DVoD) with multiple server-nodes is a cost-effective and fault-tolerant solution for a high scalable enterprise video-on-demand (VoD) system. However, such a server-oriented design is highly vulnerable to workload variations given that the service capacity is limited. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) has been introduced as an architectural solution with self-growing capacity. However, the characteristics of a pure P2P system such as the peer transient nature and high network overhead make this kind of architecture unsuitable for a fully interactive VoD system. In this paper, we propose a new efficient integrated VoD architecture, called DPn2Pm, that combines DVoD with a P2P system and multicast communications. The DVoD’s server-nodes provide a minimum required quality of service (QoS) and the P2P system is able to offer the mechanism to increase the system service capacity according to client demands. Multicast communication, wherever it is possible, is effectively exploited by our P2P system. In our design, each client is able to send video information to a set of m clients using only one multicast channel. Furthermore, the collaboration mechanism is able to coordinate a set of clients to create one collaboration group to replace the server, providing an extensive, efficient and low network-overhead collaboration mechanism from n-peers to m-peers. Regardless of the video the client is watching, our P2P scheme allows every active client to collaborate with the server. The P2P scheme is complemented with recovery mechanisms that are able to replace the failed client before affecting the QoS, offering continuous playback. The proposed approach has been broadly evaluated, firstly using a mathematical model to derive the theoretical performance and secondly using a simulation environment to analyze the system’s dynamic behavior, the VCR interaction impact and the client failures. Comparing DPn2Pm with other DVoD architectures and the most relevant P2P delivery policies, we show that our design is an improvement on previous solutions, providing a higher scalability.

AU  - Pontikakos, Costas M.

T2  - Special issue on Information and Communication Technologies in Bio and Earth Sciences
AB  - Location awareness is essential for many Precision Farming (PF) tasks with strong spatiotemporal, environmental, public health and food safety characteristics. Nevertheless, its role is much more crucial in PF tasks with efficacy depending mainly on local climate conditions and the collaboration of users. A PF task with the aforementioned characteristics is the insecticide-bait ground spraying against olive fruit fly, the most serious pest on olive cultivations. It requires location awareness, so as to be more efficient, friendly for the environment and the domestic areas, and ensure olive products with low insecticide residues. This research proposes an innovative, integrated, Location-Aware System (LAS) suitable for the ground control of the olive fruit fly. The developed system enables rapid prototyping of Location-Aware (LA) services in an intelligent PF environment combining location sensing technologies with wireless Internet, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and Expert Systems (ES). We focus on the functional and operational capabilities of the middleware architecture, on the design issues of the developed GIS, ES, and LA modules, as well as, on the factors and infrastructure that must be considered during the spraying process. Based on this framework we developed specific LA services, such as finding the area to be sprayed, estimating the amount of the spraying solution required, canceling the spraying process, etc. These services aim in a more efficient and environmental friendly treatment. To validate the LAS a moderate-scale experiment is performed showing that the proposed system is functional and operational. LAS consult effectively the tractor attendants on how to spray, by means of reducing spraying failures and minimizing the decisions that must be taken during spraying process. Preliminary results report that with LAS no over sprayings occur, sprayings are based on infestation risk, cultivation characteristics, and meteorological conditions. Finally, a safe distance from biological cultivations, environmental protected and domestic areas is kept, avoiding pollution of these areas with insecticide residues.

AU  - Goudarzi, Parisa

T2  - Journal of Network and Computer Applications
AB  - In the growing trend of globalization, the logistics and transportation play the key role in many industries. Products are shipped from one country to another. The heart of this transportation is the port, where large quantities of goods are imported and exported on daily bases. Applying Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to port warehouses is the main area of this work. Centralized warehouse management systems are prone to a single point of failure problem and are not fault tolerant. They have also limited scalability. Another issue is that the port warehouses may run by different companies and the privacy of the detailed product information must be preserved. In this paper, we design an IoT based architecture for warehouse management, according to the facts gathered from the Khorramshahr port. The main issues that this paper tries to address are: scalability, fault tolerance, and privacy. The devised architecture is named Khorramshahr (named after the name of the port). The tailored version of Chord architecture is exploited for a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which inherits the required scalability and fault tolerance. According to the devised architecture, each company can solely manage its dedicated nodes and preserve the privacy. To boost the lookup process the design is enhanced by Bloom filter and Quotient filter. Moreover, to gain performance the architecture uses a hybrid approach, which combines both the client server and the peer to peer paradigms. To evaluate the performance, the DHT of the architecture is simulated by OMNet++ and OverSim. The simulation results show that by the scaling the number of terminals from 25 to 250 the access time for an item increases only 38%. Besides, the increase in the number of requests from 10,000 to 50,000 depicts 5% and 10% improvement respectively for the lookup message latency compared to the ODSA. The simulation results also exhibit lower false positive rate for the Quotient filter approach, which makes it the first implementation candidate. Only in cases with strict constraints on memory consumption the Bloom filter approach is favored.

The quantification is achieved through the integration of two models: one that concentrates more on the structure of the power grid and its physical quantities and one that concentrates on the behavior of the control system supported by the II. The modeling approach is exemplified on a scenario whose goal is to study the effects of an II partial failure (a denial of service attack that compromises the communication network) on the remote control of the EI. The approach has been initially developed as part of the European project CRUTIAL.

AB  - This study explores the scope for increasing the contribution of woody biomass for private space and water heating in the North East Scotland, which corresponds to the administrative districts of Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray. It assesses the potential benefits in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction of a partial shift from non-renewable heat sources to wood energy. Woody biomass is an interesting case to study because it is a source of renewable energy that directly depends on the rural land use sector. At the same time woody biomass can play an important role in fuel poverty reduction. North East Scotland has good potential for woody biomass production but the trade-off between food security and energy production has to be taken into account if more woodland creation is sought. Forests occupy 19% of the land area, and a number of towns and villages are close to extensive forested areas. North East Scotland administrative districts have supported the development of wood energy through the development of woodfuel-based public service heating and institutional structure is broadly conducive. Fuel poverty and greenhouse gas emissions from space and water heating could be drastically reduced through the wide adoption of heating systems in the region. However, large up-front capital costs, delays in establishing support systems, and the nature of support offered to contribute to the likely failure to deliver policy targets such as for reduced fuel poverty and CO2 emissions reduction.

AB  - A performance analysis methodology for transmission line primary protection systems is presented, based on a probabilistic approach to protection system successful operation. The protection system operation is represented by reliability graphs, and a probabilistic model of the distance protection is considered. The system successful operation is described by tie-sets, and solutions are obtained from Monte Carlo simulation. The system elements are characterized by the reliability factors: equipment failure rate and time to repair. The system performance is assessed by the availability index. The developed methodology is applied to a transmission line protection scheme with one aided communication channel. Results allow quantifying the influence of the fault location on the protection system performance. Results also show the influence of the equipment failure rate on the system performance. The developed methodology proves to be adequate to quantify the benefits of using communication channels in transmission line protection. Furthermore it is adequate to assess different protection system architectures. A comparative performance analysis, considering four different transmission line protection schemes, can be found in the Part II paper.

AB  - Incident involving failures of anticorrosion plastic alloy composite pipe which was used for oilfield gathering and transportation had caused serious burst after several years of usage. Investigations were performed to identify the most probable causes of the pipe failures. The study was conducted by reviewing the background of the incident, inspecting visual physical morphology of the failed pipe, analyzing FTIR spectra and TG–DSC curves of inner plastic alloy and outer GRP resin. Results revealed that additives in damaged plastic alloy may not be stirred enough before extrusion or the content of additives may exceed their normal range. The lower degree of cure for resin of GRP layer leads to decrease of glass transition temperature as well as its thermal stability, which will make the outer GRP structural layer have a relatively lower mechanical property, thus giving rise to final failure of the composite pipe under the long time service conditions.

AB  - This article addresses the problem of joint optimization of production and subcontracting of unreliable production systems. The production system considered presents a common problem in the pharmaceutical industry. It is composed of multiple production facilities with different capacities, each of which is capable of producing two different classes of medications (brand name and generic). The resort to subcontracting is double: first, it involves the quantity of products received on a regular basis in order to compensate for insufficient production capacity in existing facilities, second, when needed, urgent orders are also launched in order to reduce the risk of shortages caused by breakdowns of manufacturing facilities. Failures, repairs and urgent delivery times may be represented by any probability distributions. The objective is to propose a general control policy for the system under consideration, and to obtain, in the case of two facilities, optimal control parameters that minimize the total incurred cost for a specific level of the customer service provided. Given the complexity of the problem considered, an experimental optimization approach is chosen in order to determine the optimal control parameters. This approach includes experimental design, analysis of variance, response surface methodology and simulation modeling. It allows the accurate representation of the dynamic and stochastic behaviors of the production system and the assessment of optimal control parameters. Other control parameters which represent the subcontracting are introduced and three joint production/subcontracting control policies (general, urgent, regular) are compared to one another. The proposed joint production/regular subcontracting control policy involves a cost decrease of up to 20%, as compared to results obtained by Dror et al. [1], who used a simplified control policy in addition to a heuristic solution approach for a real case study. This policy offers not only cost savings, but is also easier to manage, as compared to that proposed by Dror et al. [1]. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are also performed to illustrate the robustness of the proposed control policy and the solution approach.

AU  - O’Donnell, Garret E.
T2  - Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Through-life Engineering Services
AB  - The ultimate goal of prognostics within Through-life Engineering Services (TES) is to accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of components. Prognostic frameworks inherently presume that there is predictability in the failure rate of the system, i.e. a system experiencing exclusively stochastic failure events cannot, by definition, be predictable. Prediction model uncertainties must be bound in some logical way. Therefore, to achieve an accurate prognostic model, uncertainty must first be reduced through the identification and elimination of the root causes of random failure events. This research investigates human error in maintenance activities as a major cause of random failure events, using a case study from the biopharmaceutical industry. Elastomer failures remain the number one contamination risk in this industry and data shows unexplained variability in the lifetime of real components when compared to accelerated lifetime testing in the lab environment. Technician error during installation and maintenance activities of elastomers is one possible cause for this and this research explores how these errors can be eliminated, reduced, or accounted for within the reliability modeling process. The initial approach followed was to improve technician training in order to reduce errors and thereby reduce the variability of random failure events. Subsequent data has shown an improvement in key metrics with failures now more closely matching data from lab testing. However, there is scope for further improvements and future research will explore the role of performance influencing factors in the maintenance task to identify additional causes of variation. These factors may then be incorporated as a process variable in a prognostics and health management (PHM) model developed for the system. The paper will present these data fusion approaches accounting for human factors as a roadmap to improving PHM model reliability.

T2  - 20th European Conference on Fracture
AB  - High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is widely used for the distribution of drinking water and are exposed to an internal pressure due to water flow. Furthermore, when they are in contact with disinfectants, oxidation of HDPE occurs at the immediate surface of the inner wall. This leads to a decrease in the HDPE molar mass and consequently, to a hardening as well as an embrittlement of the material. The oxidised layer thickness seems to stabilize at 200μm whatever the initial pipe thickness due to the diffusion of reactive species in the inner wall. Inspections with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the inner wall of pipes collected on site, after several years of service, showed a network of cracks. The most noxious (deepest) longitudinal crack propagates under the steady internal pressure until the complete failure of the pipe. The experimental investigations consisted of creep crack growth tests, carried out on an original geometry for this type of test using NOL ring. These specimens were cut from the pipes and an internal longitudinal crack implanted. Creep crack growth tests were performed at various net stresses and at various crack depth ratios. At the end of each test, the time to failure was recorded. Before applying the theory of fracture mechanics of creeping solids, 3D finite element simulations were carried out to assess the suitability of assuming plane strain conditions. To this end, a porous viscoplastic model was implemented into an in-house finite element code. A fracture criterion based on critical porosity allowed for the simulation of creep crack growth. The localization of the maximum damage at mid-thickness and the thickness reduction were well captured. In these conditions, the crack front curvature is located near the surface so that a 2D calculation with plane strain conditions can then be justified to determine the C* load parameter. The residual lifetime of a real pipe containing a longitudinal defect, under in-service loading was estimated by using the correlation between the time to failure and the C*-integral.

TI  - From developmental to network state: Government restructuring and ICT-led innovation in Korea
AU  - Larson, James F.
AU  - Park, Jaemin
T2  - Telecommunications Policy
AB  - This study examines the government leadership and strategic restructuring that guided The Republic of Korea's remarkable ICT-led development from 1980 to the present. That time span coincided with tumultuous political, social and economic transformation inside Korea including the growth of such powerful chaebol industry groups as Samsung, LG and SK. Globally, the period covered by this study featured the growth of new and more powerful digital networks epitomized by the internet. It also marked South Korea's transition from a development to a network state, allowing assessment of what the experience implies for developmental state theory. This research shows that the most convincing explanation for the decline of the Korean developmental state lies in its transformation into a network state. Nevertheless, it illustrates the continuing explanatory power of key concepts from the developmental state model, including a competent bureaucracy, a political system that allows the bureaucracy sufficient autonomy, market conforming methods for state intervention, and a “control tower,” to guide industrial policy in the networked era. Korea's success suggests the value of technically trained leaders in the ICT sector, and in sharp contrast with Japan, the importance of the cross cultural experience and global outlook that many of them gained while studying at top universities in the U.S. For most of the three-plus decades in this study, the MIC served as Korea's control tower for the ICT sector, guiding policy and technology projects, and culminating in the 2006 U-Korea Master Plan, an ambitious blueprint for becoming the world's first ubiquitously networked nation. However, only two years later the Lee Myung-bak administration dismantled the ICT control tower in favor of a five year experiment with a liberal, market oriented approach to the ICT sector, much like policy in the United States. It was widely considered a failure and in 2013 President Park Geun-hye restored the control tower function within the new “super” Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning. The Korea experience also has more general implications for policymakers in the information age. These include the need for national, long-term policies, the vital role of education, ranging from highly specialized R&D to broadly-based public-private sector efforts to ensure demand for services. While Korea's past success depended heavily on the manufacture and export of hardware and infrastructure, the President Park Geun-hye administration, with its emphasis on building a “creative economy” signaled recognition that software, content and services will be more important than hardware in the future.

AB  - In 2004 the 2544m deep RWTH-1 well was drilled in the city centre of Aachen to supply geothermal heat for the heating and cooling of the new student service centre “SuperC” of RWTH Aachen University. Aachen is located in a complex geologic and tectonic position at the northern margin of the Variscan deformation front at the borders between the Brabant Massif, the Hohes Venn/Eifel areas and the presently active rift zone of the Lower Rhine Embayment, where existing data on in situ stress show complex changes over short distances. The borehole offers a unique opportunity to study varying stress regimes in this area of complex geodynamic evolution. This study of the in situ stresses is based on the observation of compressive borehole breakouts and drilling-induced tensile fractures in electrical and acoustic image logs. The borehole failure analysis shows that the maximum horizontal stress trends SE–NW which is in accordance with the general West European stress trend. Stress magnitudes modelled in accordance to the Mohr–Coulomb Theory of Sliding Friction indicate minimum and maximum horizontal stress gradients of 0.019MPa/m and 0.038MPa/m, respectively. The occurrence of drilling-induced tensile failure and the calculated in situ stress magnitudes are consistent with a model of strike-slip deformation. The observed strike-slip faulting regime supports the extension of the Brabant Shear Zone proposed by Ahorner (1975) into the Aachen city area, where it joins the major normal faulting set of the Roer Valley Graben zone. This intersection of the inherited Variscan deformation grain and the Cenozoic deformation resulting in recent strike-slip and normal faulting activity proves the tectonically different deformation responses over a short distance between the long-lived Brabant Massif and the Cenozoic Rhine Rift System.

TI  - Carbon blinkers and policy blindness: The difficulties of ‘Growing Our Woodland in Wales’
AU  - Wynne-Jones, S.
T2  - Land Use Policy
AB  - The need for climate change mitigation has led to a recent upsurge in policies aimed to deliver re-afforestation across the globe, but with mixed successes observed depending upon the levels of private land ownership and ability of governments to engage land managers. This paper evaluates a new government-led scheme in Wales, which is intended to increase woodland cover from 14% to 20% by 2030 to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. As the scheme is primarily intended to promote woodland creation on farms, the analysis of the paper focusses upon the question of how to incentivise farmers, and the reasons why difficulties have been experienced engaging land owners in the scheme. Whilst a number of recommendations are made from this policy evaluation, the paper also demonstrates that key lessons have not been applied from existing literature on farmers’ behaviour and environmental scheme uptake, and that policy makers are not integrating practice across departmental divisions. As such, the paper suggests that the new focus on carbon sequestration has acted as a distraction to the development of a more robust governance strategy that builds on previous successes and failures in agri-environment policy.

AB  - This paper presents product reliability on component basis and investigates the possible effects on warranty which constitutes a non-technical issue. Product reliability is a key factor, which is used in considering the warranty period. It plays a significant role that a mistake in warranty forecasting could cost a lot for companies. The objective is to empirically examine the nature of general reliability of manufactured goods and conduct a case study in an electronics company. In this regard, reliability will be stated from the actual manufacturing point of view. A case study was applied in manufacturing industry. LCD TVs were undertaken to follow. To test reliability, a parametric Weibull model was used and hazard rates of products were estimated with linear regression method. For this research work, the lifetime data obtained by service departments, censored both left and right. Data were used in MINITAB14 to produce the reliability results of the LCDs to reveal the relationship between product reliability and product warranty in the consumer electronics industry. In this manner, this paper would help the company to decide whether it is favorable to extend the warranty period based on the failure findings.

TI  - Long-term effects of deer browsing: Composition, structure and productivity in a northeastern Minnesota old-growth forest
AU  - White, Mark A.
T2  - Forest Ecology and Management
AB  - Although the immediate impacts of elevated deer (Odocoileus spp.) browsing on forest regeneration have been well documented, few studies have examined the longer term consequences. A deer exclosure experiment was initiated in 1991 in an old-growth northern mixed mesic forest in northeastern Minnesota, and resampled in 2008 to examine changes in composition, structure and productivity. Decades of overbrowsing by white-tailed deer have led to almost complete recruitment failure in size classes >2.5cmdbh for preferred deer browse species Thuja occidentalis and Pinus strobus in unprotected plots. Other palatable browse species have been severely limited in understory development (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Fraxinus nigra). Within exclosures, P. strobus gained in all size classes <20cmdbh, while F. nigra, B. papyrifera, T. occidentalis all showed significant gains. Non-preferred Picea glauca increased outside exclosures, but has also gained within exclosures. The increase in P. glauca across treatments indicates a long-term legacy effect of preferential browsing. Browsing induced suppression of subcanopy density of preferred species and failure of canopy tree replacement may lead to a more open woodland structure dominated by P. glauca. Browsing pressure may negatively impact productivity, as whole tree biomass in exclosures increased at a rate twice that of unprotected plots. The low biomass levels recorded in 2008 (unprotected: 98.0mg/ha−1, exclosure: 104mg/ha−1) are approximately 1/2 of values typically recorded in later successional forests in this region indicating lower productivity may be another longer-term legacy of elevated deer population. Continued high browsing pressure is one of many factors contributing to the restructuring of northern Great Lakes forests away from historical variability conditions towards a novel and more homogeneous forested landscape. These simplified forests may be less resilient to the suite of emerging stressors such as climate change and less able to provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, biological diversity and forest products. Sustained restoration efforts, along with reductions in deer density will be needed to restore species and structural diversity.

AB  - Mooring ropes are essential components of offshore installations, and synthetic ropes are increasingly preferred because of their favourable cost to weight ratios. In-service condition of these materials is traditionally monitored through costly visual inspection, which adds to the operating costs of these structures. Acoustic Emissions (AE) are widely used for condition-monitoring in air, and show great potential underwater. This paper investigates the AE signatures of synthetic mooring ropes subjected to sinusoidal tension-tension loading in a controlled environment, using a large-scale dynamic tensile test rig. With a linear array of 3 broadband (20Hz to 50kHz) hydrophones, four main signatures are identified: low-to high frequency, low-amplitude signals (50Hz to 10kHz), low-amplitude broadband signals (10kHz to 20kHz), high amplitude signals (10Hz to 48kHz) and medium-amplitude signals (500Hz to 48kHz). These AE types are related to different stages of rope behaviour, from bedding-in to degradation and failure. The main findings are that the failure location and breaking load can be identified through the detection of AE. The occurrence of high amplitude AE bursts in relation to the applied tensile load allows the detection of an imminent failure, i.e. prior to the failure event. These initial results indicate that AE analyses can enable the integrity of synthetic mooring ropes to be monitored.

It continues to represent an alarming public health threat in the region and beyond and jeopardizes the provision of health care and other services in the affected countries. The scale of the epidemic has accelerated research efforts for diagnostics, treatment, and prevention galvanized through increased availability of funding. Our knowledge relating to the virus, disease pathogenesis, risk factors, dynamics of transmission, and epidemic control is increasing, and sociocultural factors have emerged as critical determinants for the success and failure of control efforts. However, there is a long way to go. In this review we summarize the current knowledge, examine the sociocultural context in West Africa, and outline priority areas for future research.

T2  - Annals of Tourism Research
AB  - Mountain Guides and Expedition Leaders often find themselves using pack animals, such as mules, on expedition. In the absence of motorised transport, the mule’s ability to carry heavy loads over difficult mountainous terrain is thus exploited. Superficially, this can be reduced to a contractual arrangement between the mule owner and guide: the muleteer is able to secure employment because, together with his mule, he is able to offer a service in exchange for money. In employing the muleteer, the leader enters into a contract with another moral being that brings with it various rights and responsibilities. The nature of the contract between the leader and the mule, however, is far from clear and the leader’s responsibilities easily overlooked.

T2  - Collaborative Information Seeking
AB  - Search engine researchers typically depict search as the solitary activity of an individual searcher. In contrast, results from our critical-incident survey of 150 users on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service suggest that social interactions play an important role throughout the search process. A second survey of also 150 users, focused instead on difficulties encountered during searches, suggests similar conclusions. These social interactions range from highly coordinated collaborations with shared goals to loosely coordinated collaborations in which only advice is sought. Our main contribution is that we have integrated models from previous work in sensemaking and information-seeking behavior to present a canonical social model of user activities before, during, and after a search episode, suggesting where in the search process both explicitly and implicitly shared information may be valuable to individual searchers. We seek to situate collaboration in these search episodes in the context of our developed model for social search. We discuss factors that influence social interactions and content sharing during search activities. We also explore the relationship between social interactions, motivations, and query needs. Finally, we introduce preliminary findings from the second survey on difficult and failed search efforts, discussing how query needs and social interactions may differ in cases of search failures.

T2  - European Journal of Operational Research
AB  - A central design challenge facing network planners is how to select a cost-effective network configuration that can provide uninterrupted service despite edge failures. In this paper, we study the Survivable Network Design (SND) problem, a core model underlying the design of such resilient networks that incorporates complex cost and connectivity trade-offs. Given an undirected graph with specified edge costs and (integer) connectivity requirements between pairs of nodes, the SND problem seeks the minimum cost set of edges that interconnects each node pair with at least as many edge-disjoint paths as the connectivity requirement of the nodes. We develop a hierarchical approach for solving the problem that integrates ideas from decomposition, tabu search, randomization, and optimization. The approach decomposes the SND problem into two subproblems, Backbone design and Access design, and uses an iterative multi-stage method for solving the SND problem in a hierarchical fashion. Since both subproblems are NP-hard, we develop effective optimization-based tabu search strategies that balance intensification and diversification to identify near-optimal solutions. To initiate this method, we develop two heuristic procedures that can yield good starting points. We test the combined approach on large-scale SND instances, and empirically assess the quality of the solutions vis-à-vis optimal values or lower bounds. On average, our hierarchical solution approach generates solutions within 2.7% of optimality even for very large problems (that cannot be solved using exact methods), and our results demonstrate that the performance of the method is robust for a variety of problems with different size and connectivity characteristics.

AB  - The safe design of fastening systems requires an accurate understanding of all time-dependent phenomena that may lead to damage or even failure during its service life of typically 50 years. Generally, safety and serviceability requirements are ensured through rigorous experimental testing during the approval phase. In the case of time-dependent phenomena, or more specifically the behavior under sustained load, the common practice of directly testing all critical service conditions fails. The long-term response can only be approximated e.g. by short-term structural system tests that are extrapolated to the full life-time utilising empirical models as required by current guidelines. These are based on the assumption of uniformly distributed bond stress along the anchor, attribute all creep deformations to the adhesive mortar, neglect the concrete creep contribution, and assume a stationary creep process represented by a power-law. Generally, it can be assumed that reliable predictions of the time-dependent behavior of complex systems can only be obtained by models that are derived from a systematic investigation of all involved factors and their interaction. In this study, specifically the effect of concrete creep and shrinkage on the long-term behavior of adhesive anchor systems, based on extensive experimental data and numerical analyses, is investigated. A state-of-the-art computational framework is applied which can explicitly model the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms at early age and beyond. The well-established Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) describes the time-dependent mechanical response of the structure considering the local maturity of concrete, temperature, and moisture content. After calibration and validation of the numerical framework, structural deformations owing to concrete creep, bond stress redistributions over time, and the gradual development of damage at higher load levels are discussed.

AB  - The social dimensions of marine protected areas (MPAs) play an important role in MPA success, yet these social dimensions are little understood. We explore the social impacts arising from the establishment of an MPA using Lyme Bay (south west England) as a case study. Through a series of small group semi-structured interviews the social impacts experienced by fishermen (mobile and static gear), recreational users (divers and sea anglers) and recreation service providers (charter boat and dive businesses) were explored. The social impacts expressed varied according to activity in which the stakeholder group engaged. Negative themes included lengthening fishing trips, tension and conflict, fishermen identity, equity and uncertainty in the long-term. Positive themes included improved experiences for both commercial fishermen and recreational users, and expectations for long-term benefits. These impacts need to be understood because they influence stakeholder behaviour. Failure to interpret stakeholder responses may lead to poor decision-making and worsening stakeholder relations. These findings have implications for the success of the MPA in Lyme Bay, but also for the future network of marine conservation zones around the UK. Any assessment of MPA impacts must therefore identify social as well as economic and environmental change.

AB  - Health monitoring tools can be used to diagnose failures and estimate the remaining useful life of certain components, generating information that can be used to improve the management of logistics and maintenance activities in what is known as Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM). The work presented here analyzes the effect of military practices and regulations on the benefits that can be expected from installing health monitoring tools on military aircraft. The findings on the impact of the military environment on short-term and medium-term goals of maintainers and operators are key to produce an accurate and reliable Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) for IVHM technology. The results of this work are based on information obtained through the use of a questionnaire to gather the knowledge of experts in the field and by studying military standards. Secondary benefits of implementing IVHM have been studied in detail to provide a guide of which are really relevant when working on a CBA and which can be ignored. The transition from current Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) practices included in military standards to the use of continuous health monitoring tools is also discussed. The effect of current outsourcing practices, such as availability contracts, is taken into account in the analysis of these issues.

AB  - Warm or cold, wet or dry, weather impacts almost every industry as 70% of businesses are exposed to unexpected variations that influence demand for goods and services. The financial losses caused by adverse weather that did not seem material enough to have an impact or to require being managed a decade ago, may now do so as the frequency and severity of abnormal weather have dramatically increased. A surge in investigating the contribution of weather to financial distress is also prompted by more reliable weather data, and the development of new risk mitigation tools. Drawing upon the UK's retail sectors for empirical evidence, this paper provides a methodology to determine the contribution of weather to sales and to structure financial products to reduce the consequences of adverse weather on expected cash-flows. Our results open new research opportunities for weather to be considered as an additional cause of business failure.

AB  - The objective of the present work was to investigate the influence of the microstructure on the hydrogen cracking susceptibility of two typical pipeline supermartensitic stainless steels. The work has concentrated on the coarse-grained heat affected zone because this is the typical crack initiation point. The hydrogen cracking susceptibility was tested by notched tensile test samples containing a simulated coarse grained heat affected zone. The samples were tested under constant load immersed in 3.5% NaCl and subjected to a negative potential corresponding to that induced by the cathodic corrosion protection system. The load was increased by a small amount every second day in order to establish the threshold stress for hydrogen cracking during service in seawater with hydrogen being introduced on the steel surface by the cathodic protection system. A significant influence of the second heat cycle was observed. This effect was attributed to both a variation in yield strength and the influence of precipitates on hydrogen solubility and diffusion.

TI  - Asymptotic optimality of RESTART estimators in highly dependable systems
AU  - Villén-Altamirano, J.
T2  - Reliability Engineering & System Safety
AB  - We consider a wide class of models that includes the highly reliable Markovian systems (HRMS) often used to represent the evolution of multi-component systems in reliability settings. Repair times and component lifetimes are random variables that follow a general distribution, and the repair service adopts a priority repair rule based on system failure risk. Since crude simulation has proved to be inefficient for highly-dependable systems, the RESTART method is used for the estimation of steady-state unavailability and other reliability measures. In this method, a number of simulation retrials are performed when the process enters regions of the state space where the chance of occurrence of a rare event (e.g., a system failure) is higher. The main difficulty involved in applying this method is finding a suitable function, called the importance function, to define the regions. In this paper we introduce an importance function which, for unbalanced systems, represents a great improvement over the importance function used in previous papers. We also demonstrate the asymptotic optimality of RESTART estimators in these models. Several examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the new approach, and probabilities up to the order of 10−42 are accurately estimated with little computational effort.

AU  - Baroutis, Nikolaos

T2  - Computer Networks
AB  - In various applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), sensor nodes forward data packets towards an in-situ base-station (BS) over multi-hop routes. The BS not only collects and analyzes the incoming data, but also interfaces the WSN to a higher authority. The unique role of the BS attracts adversary's attention since it can be a single point of failure for the WSN. An adversary that seeks to diminish the network utility can apply traffic analysis techniques in order to uncover the sink of all traffic (i.e., the BS) and target it with denial of service attacks. In this paper, we present a technique for preserving location privacy of the BS. Our technique injects deceptive transmissions aiming to even the traffic density across the network and make the BS undistinguishable. We highlight the trade-off between location privacy and network's performance/lifetime, and show how our technique strikes a balance between conflicting metrics. The simulation results confirm that our proposed traffic analysis countermeasure effectively boosts the location privacy of the BS without a significant impact on the network's performance and lifetime.

TI  - Bounds on survival probability given mean probability of failure per demand; and the paradoxical advantages of uncertainty
AU  - Strigini, Lorenzo
AU  - Wright, David
T2  - Reliability Engineering & System Safety
AB  - When deciding whether to accept into service a new safety-critical system, or choosing between alternative systems, uncertainty about the parameters that affect future failure probability may be a major problem. This uncertainty can be extreme if there is the possibility of unknown design errors (e.g. in software), or wide variation between nominally equivalent components. We study the effect of parameter uncertainty on future reliability (survival probability), for systems required to have low risk of even only one failure or accident over the long term (e.g. their whole operational lifetime) and characterised by a single reliability parameter (e.g. probability of failure per demand – pfd). A complete mathematical treatment requires stating a probability distribution for any parameter with uncertain value. This is hard, so calculations are often performed using point estimates, like the expected value. We investigate conditions under which such simplified descriptions yield reliability values that are sure to be pessimistic (or optimistic) bounds for a prediction based on the true distribution. Two important observations are (i) using the expected value of the reliability parameter as its true value guarantees a pessimistic estimate of reliability, a useful property in most safety-related decisions; (ii) with a given expected pfd, broader distributions (in a formally defined meaning of “broader”), that is, systems that are a priori “less predictable”, lower the risk of failures or accidents. Result (i) justifies the simplification of using a mean in reliability modelling; we discuss within which scope this justification applies, and explore related scenarios, e.g. how things improve if we can test the system before operation. Result (ii) not only offers more flexible ways of bounding reliability predictions, but also has important, often counter-intuitive implications for decision making in various areas, like selection of components, project management, and product acceptance or licensing. For instance, in regulatory decision making dilemmas may arise in which the goal of minimising risk runs counter to other commonly held priorities, like predictability of risk; in safety assessment using expert opinion, the commonly recognised risk of experts being “overconfident” may be less dangerous than their being underconfident.

TI  - Performance and behavior analysis of repairable industrial systems using Vague Lambda–Tau methodology
AU  - Garg, Harish
T2  - Applied Soft Computing
AB  - To remain competitive and to provide timely and accurate services, the decision maker or system analyst view the reliability and maintainability issues as a part of corporate quest to improve quality of the products/processes and services delivered. But the collected or available data available from the historical records are mostly uncertain, limited and imprecise in nature. Thus in such situation(s), it is difficult, if not impossible, to analyze the behavior and performance of the system up to desired degree of accuracy. Thus attempt has been made by the author for analyzing the behavior and performance of the system using Vague Lambda–Tau methodology. Intuitionistic fuzzy set theory has been used for representing the classical(crisp) data into triangular fuzzy numbers because intuitionistic sets are characterized by a truth membership function and false membership functions (non-membership functions) so that sum of both values is less than 1. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed and the effects on system mean time between failures are addressed. The performance analysis of the system has been investigated through a composite measure of reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) called RAM-Index which explore the effect of failure/repair rates on system performance. Based on their performance, the most critical component of the system has been investigated. The methodology improves the shortcomings of the existing probabilistic approaches and gives a better understanding of the system behavior through its graphical representation. The pulping unit of a paper mill situated in a northern part of India, producing approximately 200ton of paper per day, has been considered to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results obtained by proposed approach are compared with the existing fuzzy Lambda–Tau and the crisp methodologies.

TI  - Overview of missing physical commodity trade data and its imputation using data augmentation
AU  - Farhan, J.
T2  - Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies
AB  - The physical aspects of commodity trade are becoming increasingly important on a global scale for transportation planning, demand management for transportation facilities and services, energy use, and environmental concerns. Such aspects (for example, weight and volume) of commodities are vital for logistics industry to allow for medium-to-long term planning at the strategic level and identify commodity flow trends. However, incomplete physical commodity trade databases impede proper analysis of trade flow between various countries. The missing physical values could be due to many reasons such as, (1) non-compliance of reporter countries with the prescribed regulations by World Customs Organization (WCO) (2) confidentiality issues, (3) delays in processing of data, or (4) erroneous reporting. The traditional missing data imputation methods, such as the substitution by mean, substitution by linear interpolation/extrapolation using adjacent points, the substitution by regression, and the substitution by stochastic regression, have been proposed in the context of estimating physical aspects of commodity trade data. However, a major demerit of these single imputation methods is their failure to incorporate uncertainty associated with missing data. The use of computationally complex stochastic methods to improve the accuracy of imputed data has recently become possible with the advancement of computer technology. Therefore, this study proposes a sophisticated data augmentation algorithm in order to impute missing physical commodity trade data. The key advantage of the proposed approach lies in the fact that instead of using a point estimate as the imputed value, it simulates a distribution of missing data through multiple imputations to reflect uncertainty and to maintain variability in the data. This approach also provides the flexibility to include fundamental distributional property of the variables, such as physical quantity, monetary value, price elasticity of demand, price variation, and product differentiation, and their correlations to generate reasonable average estimates of statistical inferences. An overview and limitations of most commonly used data imputation approaches is presented, followed by the theoretical basis and imputation procedure of the proposed approach. Lastly, a case study is presented to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach in comparison to traditional imputation methods.

AB  - This paper proposes an effective design approach for quickly determining the specification, size and amount of components of a flexible rockfall protection barrier structure. The approach is based on a reliable numerical modelling validated by several experimental tests that include both component tests and full-scale impact tests. The interception structure made up of a steel wire-ring net is accurately investigated through a series of in-plane and out-of-plane quasi-static tests carried out on net specimens, to define the ring constitutive model and failure criterion. The accuracy of the numerical strategy for an overall barrier structure with nominal energy level of 1500 kJ is validated by a full-scale in-situ test including service energy level (SEL) and maximum energy level (MEL) impacts, according to the European guidelines. From the numerical models, it is inferred that the total energy of the impact is simultaneously dissipated in different ways, where the internal energy of the structure plays a significant role. The distribution of the absorbed energy among the different barrier components is explored and defined by means of the developed finite element model. Besides, the design values of the internal force in the ropes are derived with an adequate safety margin. The proposed design procedure, applied to a barrier structure with nominal energy level of 3500 kJ, is assessed by a full-scale impact test, proving that the design approach is reliable and efficient.

AB  - This paper concerns the nondestructive testing of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV) via acoustic emission (AE) method, and more particularly Felicity effect (FE) and its ratio (FR) as pass/fail criterion. It investigates alternatives to FR since it requires an unload/load ramp. This is expensive, inconvenient, and impractical when testing and gas-filling are performed simultaneously. The investigations are achieved on a big volume COPV during a proof-pressure. The COPV was previously subjected to mechanical impacts at different energy levels and zones. Analysis of AE data in terms of zonal and planar localizations was performed. FR was investigated separately for each AE equipment channel. Results showed that the FE was followed, in the case of all sensors located near the impacted zones, indicating then the appearance of damage. It has been proven that COPV failure location was well correlated with a geographic region which had identified through zonal and planar localizations. Results showed also that in the case of the current experienced COPV, pass-fail criteria for in-service inspection during gas-filling operations (i. e. without unload/load ramp), can be based on zonal and planar localizations analysis in lieu of FR. Though FR is a good damage indicator which could support pass-fail criteria, it is not essential for real-time COPV testing during hydrogen filling, and alternatives could be found.

AB  - Internet designed over 40 years ago was originally focused on host-to-host message delivery in a best-effort manner. However, introduction of new applications over the years have brought about new requirements related with throughput, scalability, mobility, security, connectivity, and availability among others. Additionally, convergence of telecommunications, media, and information technology was responsible for transformation of the Internet into an integrated system enabling accessing, distributing, processing, storing, and managing the payload of these messages. Users are now visibly more interested in receiving / accessing information independently of the network location of its host. This consideration in turn revived the interest in named data-driven networking (a.k.a. Information-Centric Networking - ICN). Instead of assuming that networks are limited to the manipulation of network locator space, the basic assumption underneath is that information can be named, addressed, and matched independently of its network location leaving in turn the possibility to match message delivery delay requirements. In this paper, we summarize our research conducted in order to bring a completely different view / perspective of network resilience, originally defined as the ability of a network to assure an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation. That is, instead of maintaining network reachability independently of its actual utility to the “end-points”, our research aimed at exchanging and confronting the key principles that would enable an information-driven resilience (networked) scheme. More precisely, knowing that the user utility function is mainly driven nowadays by information-related criteria such as accessibility (reachability), how to design network resilience schemes that would be directed toward that goal. The main challenge is thus: can one design resilience schemes that combine maximization of end-point utility function and minimization of the network-related cost?

AB  - An integrated computational framework for textile polymer composites is introduced. A novel polymer curing model is used in connection with modeling the polymer curing process during manufacturing of textile composites. The model is based on the notion of polymer networks that are continuously formed in a body of changing shape due to changes in temperature, chemistry and external loads. Nonlinear material behavior is incorporated through nonlocal continuum damage mechanics that preserves mesh objectivity in calculations that go beyond maximum loads. The integrated model is applied to the curing of plain weave textile composites made from carbon fiber tows and Epon™862 resin. The mechanical and chemical properties are measured during curing using concurrent Brillouin and Raman light scattering. It is shown that significant stresses can develop during cure. The effect of these stresses on the manufactured part performance, when subsequent service loads are applied, is evaluated and a reduction in ultimate load, in agreement with experimental observations, is observed.

AB  - Analysis of the critical infrastructure development experiences of similar countries can help identify the critical infrastructure items that are lacking in a country of interest, mitigate the risks pertaining to policy implementation failures and provide useful planning information to policymakers. To support such examinations, a double-L fuzzy similarity model that uses the infrastructure indicators included in the World Competitiveness Yearbook of 2011 is employed. A new analytic model is then developed that leverages the fuzzy model evaluations to analyze infrastructure data and understand the leading/lagging performance of infrastructure indicators in various countries. To illustrate the application of the analytic model, 10 countries that display the most similar infrastructure development conditions to those of Taiwan (country of interest) are selected. Comparing the infrastructure indicators of the 10 similar countries can enable Taiwanese policymakers to determine the significantly leading (relatively strong), significantly lagging (relatively weak) and non-significant indicators for the Taiwan environment and help identify infrastructure items that require further investment, select benchmarks for infrastructure development and set development goals.

T2  - Special Section: Applications of Probabilistic Graphical Models in Dependability, Diagnosis and Prognosis
AB  - As a proactive risk management instrument, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) has been broadly utilized to recognize, evaluate and eliminate failure modes of products, processes, systems and services. Nevertheless, the conventional FMEA method suffers from many important deficiencies when used in the real world. First, crisp numbers are adopted to describe the risk of failure modes; but, in many practical situations, it is difficult to obtain exact assessment values due to inherent vagueness in the human judgments. Second, the priority ranking of failure modes is determined based on the risk priority number (RPN), which is questionable and strongly sensitive to the variation of risk factor ratings. Therefore, this paper applies linguistic distribution assessments to represent FMEA team members’ risk evaluation information and employs an improved TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision making) method to determine the risk priority of failure modes. Furthermore, both subjective weights and objective weights of risk factors are taken into account while conducting the risk analysis process. Finally, an empirical case concerning the risk evaluation of a grinding wheel system is presented to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed new FMEA model.

TI  - Global food security: The impact of veterinary parasites and parasitologists
AU  - Fitzpatrick, J.L.
T2  - Special Issue: One World Health - Veterinary Parasitology in the Twenty First Century
AB  - Global food security will require the production of more food using resources including land more efficiently, and with less waste. This goal must be achieved within the context of climate change and while ensuring minimal adverse environmental impact from both crop and livestock production. Disease, especially infectious disease, is a main constraint of biologically efficient livestock production and both endemic and exotic disease results in mortality and morbidity and hence less food than should ideally be available in current farming systems. A significant proportion of diseases affect the safety of food supplies, in addition to or instead of, their effect on volume and quality of food products. Parasitological diseases including those caused by nematodes, trematodes, protozoa and ectoparasites, have widely differing effects on meat, milk and fibre production and many new technologies have been developed in order to prevent or treat them. Approaches to developing better control of parasites have included livestock breeding strategies, improved nutrition and management, and the development of new drugs, diagnostic tests and vaccines. Some of the most important examples include both the development of new anthelmintic products, and better means of using existing drugs in order to maximise their effectiveness in the face of rapidly increasing parasite resistance; diagnostic tests which are able to detect low levels of nucleic acids or proteins from infectious agents rapidly; and vaccines derived from either native or recombinant proteins and designed to stimulate the most appropriate protective response from livestock species. Some of the parasitic diseases affect restricted regions around the world, however most affect very large global populations. The development of technologies of suitable and affordable livestock products for use in developing countries where most pressure on increased production for food will occur, provides a particular challenge. Most if not all new technologies form part of integrated management schemes on farms and these vary hugely in differing systems and geographical regions of the world. If the benefit of improved technologies for optimal health, welfare and biological efficiency of livestock is to be realised, then the veterinary, farming, commercial animal health and public service communities need to learn lessons from past successes and failures in the delivery of newly developed technologies to the farmer. The combination of technology and rural development in the veterinary parasitological field has played a key role in current food production and is well placed to continue this trend to help in ensuring future food requirements for the world.

T2  - Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
AB  - Biofouling significantly decreases membrane performance. So silver nanoparticle (Ag-NP) was impregnated selectively on a sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) membrane and its efficacy was tested in a continuous, cross-flow membrane module. The main challenges are: (i) to prevent biofouling on the membrane surface, (ii) achieve zero bacterial cell (E. coli) count in the permeate water, (iii) maintain Ag concentration in the permeate stream within the permissible limit of drinking water and (iv) maintain a high tensile strength of the membrane to prevent mechanical failure. Addressing these factors would ensure a long and productive service-life of the membrane. To this end, 104CFU/ml of E. coli cell-suspension was passed through the Ag-SPES membrane of 150μm total thickness, which has a narrow (1.74μm thickness), upper surface of Ag-NPs. We achieved zero E. coli cell-count and a minimum (10μg/L) Ag concentration in the permeate stream; simultaneously increasing the tensile strength from 2.78MPa to 3.92MPa due to Ag-NP impregnation. Thus, for a continuous inlet flow of E. coli contaminated water, the membrane module could deliver an almost constant permeate flow rate of 3.45L per hour, due to complete E. coli cell-killing. Simultaneously, Ag concentration in permeate stream is well-below the WHO’s recommended limit of 100μg/L, for potable quality water. Therefore, the Ag-SPES membrane can be used as an anti-biofouling membrane in a continuous operational mode.

AB  - The growth of an economy depends not only on economic factors, but also on institutions, the citizens’ trust in them, by the sharing of values and expectations. The differences between public policies and institutions are often regarded as one of the key explanations of the wide differences in levels and growth rates of per capita across countries. Among the institutions that have the greatest impact on economic performance, the legal and judicial system plays a prominent role. Understanding how laws and regulations affect economic behaviour is fundamental in modern economies and the economy facilitates the identification of those that are, in each country system, the incentives to the litigation, the process of litigation itself and the costs, in order to verify the distributive impact of the different legal and judicial systems and what features they should have to encourage economic growth. The operation of a legal system may impact on many dimensions of development: equity, the optimal allocation of resources, and the increase in total factor productivity. Moreover, the role of the judicial system in determining its dysfunctions can affect economic growth. In fact, Italian economic growth has been and is definitely hampered by the length as well as by the civil and criminal justice processes, which reduces legal certainty and confidence, increases the risk of economic activities and therefore reduces the propensity to invest. The Italian judicial system has many efficiency and organization problems, resulting in a lack of its credibility. These are very intricate, and are the product of a mixture of features that are very difficult to isolate. The aim of this work is to assess the ways in which the administration of justice in Italy influences the choices and behaviours of the two main economic actors - households and businesses - analysing if there is any (a) symmetry in their preferences. In fact, there are many factors that determine the failure of Italian justice, and among these also the users of the justice services produce a collapse in justice system when they take legal actions only for postponing a payment or avoiding an obligation. Thus, the source of the problem and its resolution could be identified in the distorted incentives generated by all of the rules connected with the process.

AB  - Thermoplastic pipes are used in all the industrial fields such as water, sewage and gas piping systems and other industrial applications, like the transport of minerals and slurries. The choice of the right piping system's material depends on many criteria. First of all, it depends on the conditions of use of each kind of material. Secondly, it depends on the cost of the chosen material and finally the mastering of the material's scenarios of failure. The last criteria are possible through the mastering of the material characteristics and the capability to detect the failure, burst or crack, before its occurrence. The adopted approach must be proactive to facilitate the prediction of the failure and help the maintenance staff to apprehend the piping system's damage at the right time. In this paper, we chose HDPE pipes as material for our study. Then, we leaded a new approach of failure analysis and prediction using new models. These models are obtained through a modified version of the stress controlled unified theory, a static damage model using burst pressures and a static damage model using the time to failure. For that reason, we used burst pressures of undamaged HDPE pipe instead of ultimate stresses. Then, we created groove notches with different levels of depth. The obtained burst pressures from these pipes have been considered as the residual burst pressures used in our damage models. The representation of the obtained data according to the life fraction gave us an idea about the critical life fraction and then the critical groove depth which can be allowed. This information has been confirmed by three damage models. Then, we determined the different stages of damage to help the predictive maintenance to define the safe intervals of the HDPE pipes' service. Moreover, the three developed models, presented in this paper, represent a simplified approach to assess the damage based on static tests only, without doing any dynamic tests. The developed cost-effective approach can be a tool that can help the industrials to have an anticipative maintenance strategy and respect the safety requirements. Also, it can help them to do quick checks or launch audit mission to the manufacturers' factories for HDPE pipes' quality control and conformity check regarding the codes.

AB  - In fusion research the ability to generate and sustain high performance fusion plasmas gains more and more importance. Optimal combinations of magnetic shape, temperature and density profiles as well as the confinement time are identified as advanced regimes. Safe operation in such regimes will be crucial for the success of ITER and later fusion reactors. The operational space, on the other hand, is characterized by nonlinear dependencies between plasma parameters. Various MHD limits must be avoided in order to minimize the risk of a disruption. Sophisticated feedback control schemes help to tackle this challenge. But these in turn require detailed information on plasma state in time to allow proper reaction. Control system and diagnostic systems therefore must establish a symbiotic relationship to carry out such schemes. Today, all major fusion devices implement such a concept. An implementation of such a concept with sustained integration is presented using the example of ASDEX Upgrade. It covers data communication via a real-time network, synchronization mechanisms for data-driven algorithm execution as well as operational aspects and exception handling for failure detection and recovery. A modular distributed software framework offers standardized user algorithm interfaces, automated workflow procedures and the application of various computer and network hardware components. Designed with a special focus on reliability, robustness and flexibility, it is a sound base for exploring ITER-relevant plasma regimes and control strategies.

T2  - Theory and Practice of Stochastic Modeling
AB  - Quality standards impose increasingly stringent requirements and constraints on quality of service attributes and measures. As a consequence, aspects, phenomena, and behaviors, hitherto approximated or neglected, have to be taken into account in quantitative assessment in order to provide adequate measures satisfying smaller and smaller confidence intervals and tolerances. With specific regards to reliability and availability, this means that interferences and dependencies involving the components of a system can no longer be neglected. Therefore, in order to support such a trend, specific techniques and tools are required to adequately deal with dynamic aspects in reliability and availability assessment. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how state–space based techniques can satisfy such a demand. For this purpose some examples of specific dynamic reliability behaviors, such as common cause failure and load sharing, are considered applying state–space based techniques to study the corresponding reliability models. Different repair policies in availability contexts are also explored. Both Markovian and non-Markovian models are studied via phase type expansion and renewal theory in order to adequately represent and evaluate the considered dynamic reliability aspects in case of generally distributed lifetimes and times to repair.

T2  - Economic Analysis and Policy
AB  - This paper addresses less recognised factors which influence the diffusion of a particular technology. While an innovation’s attributes and performance are paramount, many fail because of external factors which favour an alternative. This paper, with theoretic input from diffusion, lock-in and path-dependency, presents a qualitative study of external factors that influenced the evolution of transportation in USA. This historical account reveals how one technology and its emergent systems become dominant while other choices are overridden by socio-political, economic and technological interests which include not just the manufacturing and service industries associated with the automobile but also government and market stakeholders. Termed here as a large socio-economic regime (LSER), its power in ensuring lock-in and continued path-dependency is shown to pass through three stages, weakening eventually as awareness improves. The study extends to transport trends in China, Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia and they all show the dominant role of an LSER. As transportation policy is increasingly accountable to address both demand and environmental concerns and innovators search for solutions, this paper presents important knowledge for innovators, marketers and policy makers for commercial and societal reasons, especially when negative externalities associated with an incumbent transportation technology may lead to market failure.

AB  - Earth observation allows the separation of snow cover and cloudiness using multispectral measurements. Several satellite-based snow monitoring services are available, ranging from regional to world-wide scales. Using these data enables photovoltaic (PV) plant management to differentiate between failures due to snow coverage on a PV system and other error sources. Additionally, yield estimates for solar siting are improved. This paper presents a validation study from January to April 2006 comparing satellite-based datasets with ground measurements from German and Swiss meteorological stations. A false alarm rate, an error due to irradiance underestimation, the availability of daily data, and the classification accuracy are introduced as quality metrics. Compared to Switzerland, generally a higher accuracy is found in all datasets for Southern Germany. The most significant difference among the datasets is found in the error pattern shifting from too much snow (which results in an error due to underestimation of irradiance) to too little snow detection, causing a false alarm in PV monitoring. Overall, the data records of the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility (LSA SAF), the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) are found to be most suitable for solar energy purposes. The IMS dataset has a low false alarm rate (4%) and a good data availability (100%) making it a good choice for power plant monitoring, but the error due to underestimation relevant in site auditing is large with 59%. If a cumulative snow cover algorithm is applied to achieve information every day as needed both for power plant monitoring and site auditing, both the DLR and the LSA SAF datasets are comparable with classification accuracies of 70%, false alarm rates of 37% and 34%, respectively, and errors due to irradiance underestimation in 26% and 27% of all coincidences.

AB  - Summary
Influenza is a common seasonal viral infection that affects large numbers of people. In early 2009, many people were admitted to hospitals in Mexico with severe respiratory failure following an influenza-like illness, subtyped as H1N1. An increased mortality rate was observed. By June 2009, H1N1 was upgraded to pandemic status. In June–July, Australian ICUs were experiencing increased activity due to the influenza pandemic. While hospitals implemented plans for the pandemic, the particularly heavy demand to provide critical care facilities to accommodate an influx of people with severe respiratory failure became evident and placed a great burden on provision of these services. This paper describes the initial experience (June to mid September) of the pandemic from the nursing perspective in a single Australian ICU. Patients were noted to be younger with a higher proportion of women, two of whom were pregnant. Two patients had APACHE III comorbidity. Of the 31 patients admitted during this period, three patients died in ICU and one patient died in hospital. Aerosol precautions were initiated for all patients. The requirement for single room accommodation placed enormous demands for bed management in ICU. Specific infection control procedures were developed to deal with this new pandemic influenza.

AB  - A metal–ceramic bonding process was developed to produce vacuum tight alumina–Inconel 600 joints using an Ag-based active metal brazing alloy that can withstand continuous operating temperature up to 560°C. The microstructure and microchemistry of the braze zone was examined using extensive microanalysis of the constituent phases and a mechanism for the interfacial reactions responsible for the bonding is proposed. Prolonged heat treatment at 400 and 560°C under simulated in-service conditions revealed that the microstructure of braze zone of the joints was stable and maintained leak-tightness and strength. The bond strength of the interface was high enough to cause failure in the alumina side of the joints. Failure of the joints was caused by initiation of crack on the surface of alumina as a result of high tensile residual stress adjacent to the metal–ceramic interface.

AB  - Rubbery materials are widely used in industrial applications and are often exposed to cyclic stress and strain conditions while in service. To ensure safety and reliability, quantifying the effect of loads on the life of rubbery material is an important but challenging task, due to the combination of geometric/material nonlinearities and loading conditions for extended time durations. In this work, a novel simulation approach based on nonlinear space-time finite element method (FEM) is presented with a goal to capture fatigue failure in rubbery material subjected to cyclic loads. It is established by integrating the time discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) formulation with nonlinear material constitutive laws. A continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model is introduced to account for the damage evolution and model parameters for synthetic rubber are calibrated based on experiment. The nonlinear space-time FEM coupled with CDM constitutive model shows good agreement with the fracture and low cycle fatigue test of notched rubber sheet specimen.

AB  - Background
Cardiovascular conditions rank sixth in causes of death in 1- to 19-year-olds. Our study is the first analysis of the cardiovascular death data set from the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths, which provides the only systematic collection of cardiovascular deaths in children.
Methods
We developed an analytical data set from the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths database for cardiovascular deaths in children 0 to 21 years old, reviewing 1,098 cases from 2005 to 2009 in 16 states who agreed to participate.
Results
Cardiovascular cases were aged 4.8 ± 6.6 years; 55.3%, ≤1 year; 24.6%, ≥10 years; male, 58%; white, 70.5%; black, 22.3%; Hispanic, 19.5%. Prior conditions were present in 48.5%: congenital heart disease, 23%; cardiomyopathies, 4.6%; arrhythmia, 1.7%; and congestive heart failure, 1.6%. Deaths occurred most frequently in urban settings, 49.2%; and in the hospital, 40.4%; home, 26.1%; or at school/work/sports, 4.8%. Emergency medical services were not evenly distributed with differences by age, race, ethnicity, and area. Autopsies (40.4%) occurred more often in those >10 years old (odds ratio [OR] 2.9), blacks (OR 1.6), or in those who died at school/work/sports (OR 3.9). The most common cardiovascular causes of death included congenital heart disease, 40.8%; arrhythmias, 27.1%; cardiomyopathy, 11.8%; myocarditis, 4.6%; congestive heart failure, 3.6%; and coronary artery anomalies, 2.2%.
Conclusions
Our study identified differences in causes and frequencies of cardiovascular deaths by age, race, and ethnicity. Prevention of death may be impacted by knowledge of prior conditions, emergency plans, automated external defibrillator programs, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation education, and by a registry for all cardiovascular deaths in children.

AB  - Fatigue testing of cord-rubber composites is of significant interest as components manufactured from these materials are typically subjected to repeated loading during service. In this work, initial fatigue tests on a single carbon cord reinforced hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (CC-HNBR) model composite were undertaken using conventional wedge grips which are routinely employed for fatigue testing of cord-rubber composites. Damage evolution was monitored using thermal imaging, while post-failure modes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to understand the stress state in the gripping region. The observed failure mode in wedge grips based testing was found to be interfacial debonding as a consequence of shear stress concentrations induced by the grips, leading to a significant underestimation of fatigue life. Consequently, an alternative bollard based test methodology was developed for cord-rubber composites. Fatigue data generated using this novel bollard test set-up was compared with data obtained by using conventional wedge grips. Bollard-based testing resulted in tensile fatigue behaviour dominated by cord failure rather than failure by interfacial debonding during accelerated laboratory fatigue testing, making the developed test methodology better suited for the characterisation of intrinsic fatigue behaviour of cord-rubber composites.

AB  - Due to the rapid expansion of Internet and the huge proliferation of users, Internet has evolved from a host-centric model to a content-oriented model. This implies the in-adaptation of current TCP/IP architecture providing the best performance to end-users and the urgency of researching future Internet architecture. In future Internet, the named data rather than traditional IP address may become the thin waist of the hourglass model of networking. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a cache-aware social-based Quality of Service (QoS) routing scheme for Named Data Networking (NDN) in Information Centric Network (ICN). Three kinds of social relationships, namely neighbors (NB), interest friends (IF) and response friends (RF) are devised to describe the relationships among nodes. Thus, when there is a failure in doing Pending Interest Table (PIT) scheme, a forwarding scheme based on social relationships is done before doing Forwarding Information Base (FIB) scheme. Moreover, a caching policy and its corresponding replacement policy based on content popularity, cache space and neighbor caching information are proposed. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme has better performance, including a higher routing success ratio, than NDN routing mechanism.

Besides common aspects of design, specific features such as corrosion and impact damage from flying ballast are discussed which may reduce the fatigue strength of axles during service. Potential effects of non-metallic inclusions from the steel manufacturing process are addressed in the context of the very high number of loading cycles railway axles are designed for. With respect to damage tolerance general lines of fracture mechanics residual lifetime analyses are introduced. More specific discussion is provided on aspects such as the threshold value of fatigue crack propagation and reliability aspects of non-destructive inspection.
